what: |
  Archaeological analysis of TMNN — Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews.
  The code ESR hid in "secret laboratories" for 2 years while 
  preaching "release early, release often."

why: |
  872 calls to unsafe C functions from the author of:
  - "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"
  - "The Art of Unix Programming"
  The contradiction is the content.
