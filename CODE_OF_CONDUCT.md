# Code of Conduct

## Preamble: Why We Have One

Eric S. Raymond [advocates abolishing codes of conduct entirely](https://itsfoss.com/news/codes-of-conduct-debate/). He calls them "weapons in the hands of shit-stirrers" and "control surfaces for shit-stirrers to manipulate."

In 2020, ESR was [banned from the Open Source Initiative](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/136-open-source/13535-co-founder-of-osi-banned-from-.html) — the organization he co-founded — for violating its Code of Conduct on mailing lists.

He argues that the only rule open source projects need is: *"If you are more annoying to work with than your contributions justify, you'll be ejected."*

**We disagree.**

Codes of conduct exist to protect communities from people who threaten others, harass marginalized groups, and believe their perceived genius exempts them from basic human decency. They protect the *"missing stairs"* — the people everyone knows to avoid but nobody will publicly name.

This project has a Code of Conduct. It's not optional.

## The ESR Code of Conduct

*What our Code of Conduct would look like if it were based on ESR's actual behavior:*

### Article 1: The Right to Be Rude

> Participants have [the right to be rude](https://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609). Tone policing is forbidden. If your feelings are hurt, that's your problem.

### Article 2: Threats Are Just Rhetoric

> If you [threaten another contributor](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/04/msg00197.html) with statements like *"I will find a way to make you regret it"* while being a known firearms enthusiast, simply clarify later that you only meant to threaten their reputation, not their life.

### Article 3: Meritocracy Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry

> Your code contributions entitle you to say whatever you want about race, gender, or sexual orientation. If anyone objects, accuse them of [being an SJW](https://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6918) who wants to destroy meritocracy.

### Article 4: Weapons-Grade Rhetoric

> Statements like *"I've got some bullets slathered in pork fat to make you feel extra special welcome"* are [acceptable discourse](https://web.archive.org/web/20090624235730/http://www.catb.org/esr/nedanet/).

### Article 5: The Honeytrap Exception

> If women accuse men of misconduct at tech conferences, assume without evidence that it's a [coordinated feminist conspiracy](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6907) to frame male developers.

### Article 6: Ejection Criteria

> *"If you are more annoying to work with than your contributions justify, you'll be ejected."* — [ESR's proposed universal CoC](https://itsfoss.com/news/codes-of-conduct-debate/)

> (Note: "Annoying" is defined solely by whoever has the most social capital.)

## Our Actual Code of Conduct

**We reject all of the above.**

### Our Standards

This project is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive environment for everyone. We expect all participants to:

1. **Be respectful.** Disagreement is fine. Personal attacks are not.

2. **No threats.** Not even "rhetorical" ones. Not even if you later claim you only meant to threaten someone's reputation.

3. **No harassment.** This includes racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise discriminatory comments — regardless of how much code you've contributed.

4. **No conspiracy theories about marginalized groups.** Claiming that women or minorities are orchestrating secret campaigns against you is not acceptable.

5. **Assume good faith** — but verify. "Many eyes" applies to behavior, not just code.

6. **Accept feedback gracefully.** If someone tells you your behavior is problematic, consider that they might be right.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All repository interactions (issues, PRs, discussions, wiki)
- Related communications (social media, conferences, etc.)
- Any context where you're representing this project

### Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- A warning
- Temporary suspension
- Permanent ban

We will not wait 20 years to enforce our standards.

### The Irony

ESR spent decades arguing that codes of conduct are unnecessary because open source communities are self-policing meritocracies. Then he got banned from his own organization for violating its Code of Conduct.

**Codes of conduct don't exist to silence dissent. They exist to protect communities from people who believe their status exempts them from accountability.**

They protect communities from the *missing stairs* — the people everyone knows to avoid, whose behavior is excused because "that's just how they are" or "but their contributions are so valuable."

ESR was a missing stair. Many communities stepped around him for decades. Eventually, one didn't.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness a violation of this Code of Conduct:

- **Email:** [Open an issue](../../issues/new?title=CoC%20Report&labels=conduct) (for public reports)
- **Private:** Contact the maintainers directly

All reports will be reviewed and investigated. We will maintain confidentiality where possible.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.

The satirical "ESR Code of Conduct" section is documented from ESR's own public statements, linked to primary sources. We didn't make any of it up. *He actually said and did all of that.*

---

## A Final Note

ESR once wrote that codes of conduct represent *"a kind of infectious social insanity producing lots of drama and politics and backbiting."*

We think the "drama and politics and backbiting" comes from people who threaten colleagues, post racist screeds, spread conspiracy theories about women in tech, and then complain when they face consequences.

**The call is coming from inside the house.**

*"It's always the missing stairs that complain about the railing."*
