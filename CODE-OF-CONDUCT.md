# Code of Conduct

## Preamble: Why We Have One

Eric S. Raymond [advocates abolishing codes of conduct entirely](https://itsfoss.com/news/codes-of-conduct-debate/). He calls them "weapons in the hands of shit-stirrers" and "control surfaces for shit-stirrers to manipulate."

In 2020, ESR was [banned from the Open Source Initiative](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/136-open-source/13535-co-founder-of-osi-banned-from-.html) — the organization he co-founded — for violating its Code of Conduct on mailing lists.

He argues that the only rule open source projects need is: *"If you are more annoying to work with than your contributions justify, you'll be ejected."*

**We have a Code of Conduct because it pisses him off.**

## A Note on Enforcement

This is **performance art**. This entire repository is a satirical community code review of ESR's abandoned project, conducted in the spirit of his own stated principles.

**We are not going to enforce anything.** 

We *want* this to go off the rails. We *want* the worst of Hacker News and the internet to show up and reveal themselves for what they truly are. Every unhinged comment, every defensive screed, every "well actually" — it all becomes part of the exhibit.

The Issues are open. The Discussions are open. Come one, come all.

*Let the many eyes see everything.*

## A Message to ESR's Defenders

We know who's coming.

ESR has cultivated a following over the decades. Not just curious programmers or open source historians — but a particular kind of supporter. The kind who shows up whenever someone criticizes their guy. The kind who thinks "free speech" means freedom from consequences. The kind who migrated from platform to platform as each one eventually decided that harassment isn't a feature.

**We see you.**

To the Kiwi Farms alumni still looking for a new hobby: Welcome. Your posting style is distinctive. 

To the MAGA tech bros who think ESR is being "canceled" for "just asking questions" about race and IQ: He's not being canceled. He's being quoted. Accurately. With links.

To the "free speech absolutists" who defend pork-fat bullet threats as legitimate discourse: Please, tell us more about your principles. In the Issues. Publicly. With your real account.

To the white supremacists who appreciated ESR's Bell Curve citations and "Haiti is full of violent idiots" commentary: We've documented all of it. With sources. You're welcome to defend it. On the record.

To the anti-CoC crusaders who think this document proves codes of conduct are "weapons": You're right. This one is. Against you. Specifically.

**This is a trap and you're walking into it.**

Every comment you leave, every issue you open, every defensive screed about how we're "taking things out of context" — it all becomes part of the permanent record. The many eyes are watching. The archive is forever.

ESR spent decades saying the internet never forgets. He was right. It doesn't.

So please: Come defend him. Tell us how the real problem is "SJWs" and "cancel culture." Explain how threatening colleagues is just "being direct." Enlighten us about race science.

**We'll be documenting everything.**

## The ESR Code of Conduct

*What our Code of Conduct would look like if it were based on ESR's actual behavior:*

### Article 1: The Right to Be Rude

> Participants have [the right to be rude](https://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609). Tone policing is forbidden. If your feelings are hurt, that's your problem.

### Article 2: Threats Are Just Rhetoric

> If you [threaten another contributor](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/04/msg00197.html) with statements like *"I will find a way to make you regret it"* while being a known firearms enthusiast, simply clarify later that you only meant to threaten their reputation, not their life.

### Article 3: Meritocracy Means Never Having to Say You're Sorry

> Your code contributions entitle you to say whatever you want about race, gender, or sexual orientation. If anyone objects, accuse them of [being an SJW](https://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6918) who wants to destroy meritocracy.

### Article 4: Weapons-Grade Rhetoric

> Statements like *"I've got some bullets slathered in pork fat to make you feel extra special welcome"* are [acceptable discourse](https://web.archive.org/web/20090624235730/http://www.catb.org/esr/nedanet/).

### Article 5: The Honeytrap Exception

> If women accuse men of misconduct at tech conferences, assume without evidence that it's a [coordinated feminist conspiracy](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6907) to frame male developers.

### Article 6: Ejection Criteria

> *"If you are more annoying to work with than your contributions justify, you'll be ejected."* — [ESR's proposed universal CoC](https://itsfoss.com/news/codes-of-conduct-debate/)

> (Note: "Annoying" is defined solely by whoever has the most social capital.)

## The Missing Stair

You know the concept of the [missing stair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_stair)?

> A "missing stair" is a person within a social group who is known to be harmful but whom the group works around instead of confronting or removing.

Codes of conduct exist to protect communities from the *missing stairs* — the people everyone knows to avoid, whose behavior is excused because "that's just how they are" or "but their contributions are so valuable."

ESR was a missing stair. Many communities stepped around him for decades. 

Eventually, one didn't.

**It's always the missing stairs that complain about the railing.**

---

## Our "Actual" Code of Conduct

*For the record, here's what a reasonable Code of Conduct looks like. We're not enforcing it — this is performance art — but we're documenting it for contrast.*

### What Normal Projects Expect:

1. **Be respectful.** Disagreement is fine. Personal attacks are not.

2. **No threats.** Not even "rhetorical" ones. Not even if you later claim you only meant to threaten someone's reputation.

3. **No harassment.** This includes racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise discriminatory comments — regardless of how much code you've contributed.

4. **No conspiracy theories about marginalized groups.** Claiming that women or minorities are orchestrating secret campaigns against you is not acceptable.

5. **Assume good faith** — but verify. "Many eyes" applies to behavior, not just code.

6. **Accept feedback gracefully.** If someone tells you your behavior is problematic, consider that they might be right.

### Why This Matters

ESR spent decades arguing that codes of conduct are unnecessary because open source communities are self-policing meritocracies.

Then he got banned from his own organization for violating its Code of Conduct.

**Codes of conduct don't exist to silence dissent. They exist to protect communities from people who believe their status exempts them from accountability.**

---

## The Irony Section

ESR once wrote that codes of conduct represent *"a kind of infectious social insanity producing lots of drama and politics and backbiting."*

We think the "drama and politics and backbiting" comes from people who:
- Threaten colleagues
- Post racist screeds
- Spread conspiracy theories about women in tech
- And then complain when they face consequences

**The call is coming from inside the house.**

---

## Attribution

The satirical "ESR Code of Conduct" section is documented from ESR's own public statements, linked to primary sources.

We didn't make any of it up. *He actually said and did all of that.*

This document exists as a rhetorical artifact — part of a performance art code review of ESR's abandoned TMNN project.

---

## Come Join the Circus

This Code of Conduct exists to make a point, not to be enforced.

The Issues are open. The Discussions are open. We welcome:
- Thoughtful critique
- Unhinged rants
- Defensive screeds from ESR apologists
- "Well actually" pedantry
- Whatever chaos the internet brings

**It's all part of the exhibit.**

Many eyes. Many opinions. Many flames.

*Let's see what crawls out of the woodwork.*

---

*"Be careful what you wish for. You might get it."*

<details>
<summary>...</summary>

## The Confession

*You made it to the end. Nobody reads this far.*

Here's the thing: We don't actually hate ESR. We don't know him. Most of us have never met him.

What we hate is what he represents. The archetype. The guy who built his career on principles he never applied to himself. The guy who preached openness while hiding his failures. The guy who demanded accountability from others while believing his status exempted him from consequences.

There are a thousand ESRs in tech. In every industry. In every community. The brilliant asshole whose contributions supposedly justify his behavior. The missing stair everyone works around. The guy who's been "grandfathered in" to norms he'd never survive if he started today.

This repository isn't really about one man's abandoned Usenet software from 1989. It's about the pattern. The hypocrisy. The way certain people get to fail upward while preaching meritocracy to everyone else.

ESR is just the case study. The receipts happen to be unusually well-documented.

If you came here to defend him: Ask yourself why. Is it because you actually think his code was good? Is it because you think his conduct was acceptable? Or is it because you see yourself in him, and his fall from grace feels like a threat?

If you came here to pile on: Ask yourself the same questions. Are you here for justice, or for the dopamine hit of righteous anger? Is this productive, or is it just satisfying?

If you came here out of curiosity: Welcome. Poke around. Form your own opinions. The sources are linked. The code is readable. The history is documented.

And if you're ESR himself, reading this at 3am, wondering what happened to your legacy:

You told everyone to show you the code. We did.

You said many eyes make all bugs shallow. They do.

You demanded the right to be rude. You got it.

You spent decades building a reputation. This is part of it now.

The internet never forgets. You said so yourself.
