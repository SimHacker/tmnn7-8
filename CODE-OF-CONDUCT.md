# Code of Conduct

## We're Just Following ESR's Rules

Eric S. Raymond [proposed](https://itsfoss.com/news/codes-of-conduct-debate/) that open source projects need only one rule:

> *"If you are more annoying to work with than your contributions justify, you'll be ejected."*

**We agree.** Let's apply this standard consistently.

---

## Applying ESR's Own Standard

ESR argues that the value of your contributions should be weighed against the annoyance you cause. Fair enough. Let's do the math.

### ESR's Contributions

| Contribution | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| TMNN (Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews) | Abandoned at beta 7.8, 774 buffer overflows |
| fetchmail | [Security nightmare](https://docs.freebsd.org/cgi/getmsg.cgi?fetch=585008+0+archive/2001/freebsd-arch/20010218.freebsd-arch), abandoned when "finished" |
| "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" | ["Has not held up at all; it's actively bad"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18442637) — tptacek |
| "Linus's Law" | [A quote Linus never said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law), [called "a fallacy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law) |
| Jargon File stewardship | ["Disrespectful parasitical vandalism"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43133598) — DonHopkins |
| Open Source Initiative | Co-founded it, then [banned from it](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/136-open-source/13535-co-founder-of-osi-banned-from-.html) |

### ESR's Annoyance

| Behavior | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Threatened Bruce Perens: *"I will find a way to make you regret it"* | [Debian mailing list, 1999](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/04/msg00197.html) |
| *"I've got some bullets slathered in pork fat to make you feel extra special welcome"* | [His website, 2009](https://web.archive.org/web/20090624235730/http://www.catb.org/esr/nedanet/) |

| *"The average black American has an IQ about 85 and that is pretty much a disqualifier"* | [His blog](http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8139#comment-2054055) |
| *"Haiti is, quite literally, a country full of violent idiots"* | [His blog](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20406253) |
| Defended colleague who posted "Blacks are Lazy", called critics "thugs" | [eWeek, 2005](http://www.eweek.com/servers/new-osi-president-steps-down) |
| Claimed climate scientists committed fraud based on *commented-out code* | [His blog, 2009](https://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1447) — [debunked](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond#Climategate) |
| Banned from OSI mailing lists for CoC violations | [2020](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/136-open-source/13535-co-founder-of-osi-banned-from-.html) |

### The Calculation

By ESR's own formula:

```
if (annoyance > contributions) { eject(); }
```

**Result:** `eject()`

ESR would fail his own Code of Conduct.

## ESR's Other Principles (Applied Consistently)

### "The Right to Be Rude"

ESR [argues](https://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609) that participants have "the right to be rude" and that "tone policing" is unacceptable.

**We agree.** That's why we're being rude about his 774 buffer overflows. If he doesn't like our tone, that's his problem.

### "Show Me the Code"

ESR's famous principle: technical merit is what matters. Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

**We agree.** We're showing everyone his code. All of it. Including `fascist.c`. Including the `gets()` in the headers. Including the 774 buffer overflows.

If he doesn't like people looking at his code, perhaps he shouldn't have spent decades telling everyone that open source means anyone can look at your code.

### "Many Eyes Make All Bugs Shallow"

ESR [coined this phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law). He believes code review makes software better.

**We agree.** That's why we're reviewing his code. With many eyes. In public. On GitHub.

If he didn't want his code reviewed, perhaps he shouldn't have built his entire career on the principle that code review is good, actually.

### Meritocracy

ESR argues that open source is a meritocracy where only technical contributions matter.

**We agree.** His code has 774 buffer overflows. On technical merit alone, it fails.

## Our Actual Standards

Since we're applying ESR's principles consistently, here's what that means in practice:

### 1. Contributions Must Justify Behavior

If your contributions don't justify your annoyance, you'll be asked to leave. This applies to everyone, including people who think they're too important for consequences.

### 2. The Right to Be Rude (Applies Both Ways)

You have the right to be blunt about bad code. We have the right to be blunt about yours. Don't dish it out if you can't take it.

### 3. Show Us the Code

We evaluate contributions on technical merit. If your code has 774 buffer overflows, we're going to talk about that. Loudly. In public.

### 4. Many Eyes

All conduct is subject to community review. If you threaten people, post racist screeds, or spread conspiracy theories, the many eyes will see it. And document it. With links.

### 5. No Special Pleading

"But I co-founded the Open Source Initiative" is not a defense. "But I wrote The Cathedral and the Bazaar" is not a defense. Your past contributions do not exempt you from current standards.

The same rules apply to everyone. *Especially* to people who spent decades insisting the rules should apply to everyone.

---

## Enforcement

Violations will be handled according to ESR's own principle:

> *"If you are more annoying to work with than your contributions justify, you'll be ejected."*

We'll apply this standard fairly and consistently — which is apparently more than ESR ever expected anyone to do.

---

## The Irony

ESR spent decades arguing against codes of conduct. He said they were unnecessary because open source communities are self-policing meritocracies.

Then he got banned from his own organization for violating its Code of Conduct.

He said the only rule you need is "don't be more annoying than your contributions justify."

By that standard, he fails.

He said "show me the code."

We're showing everyone his code.

He said "many eyes make all bugs shallow."

The many eyes have arrived.

**We're not doing anything ESR hasn't advocated for. We're just applying his principles to him.**

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct implements ESR's own stated principles, cited to primary sources.

We didn't make any of this up. He actually said all of it. We're just taking him seriously.

*"Be careful what you wish for. You might get it."*
