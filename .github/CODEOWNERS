# 🛡️ CODEOWNERS - Gatekeeping the Multiverse
#
# PRs touching these files require review before merging to main.
# This prevents hostile branches from vandalizing enemy characters.
#
# RULE: You can fork, you can branch, you can diverge.
#       Sync FROM main is automatic (Multiverse Sync workflow).
#       Merge TO main requires approval.
