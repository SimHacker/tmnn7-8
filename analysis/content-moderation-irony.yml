later_positions:
  # ESR's later public positions on content moderation
  
  against_moderation:
    pattern: |
      ESR spent decades arguing that any form of content moderation, 
      codes of conduct, or community guidelines are forms of tyranny 
      and censorship.
      
  osi_ban_context:
    year: 2020
    position: |
      Argued against "ethical licensing" that would allow projects to 
      exclude certain organizations. Called it an attack on "liberty."
    result: "Banned from OSI for Code of Conduct violations"
    
  honeytrap_conspiracy:
    year: 2015
    position: |
      Claimed feminist-pushed codes of conduct at tech conferences were 
      cover for "honeytrap" operations to frame male developers.
      
  jargon_file_defense:
    position: |
      Resisted calls to moderate his edits to the Jargon File, despite 
      criticism that he had injected his political views.

the_irony:
  summary: |
    The man who literally wrote access control code called "fascist.c" 
    with functions to restrict who could post to newsgroups spent 
    decades arguing that any form of content moderation is tyranny.
    
  detailed:
    what_he_built:
      - "Code to control who can post"
      - "Code to control who can read"
      - "Data structures to track 'nasty' users"
      - "Example showing 'miscreants' restricted from certain groups"
      - "Site banning capability"
      
    what_he_preached:
      - "Content moderation is tyranny"
      - "Codes of conduct are tools of oppression"
      - "Open source should have no restrictions"
      - "Social justice has no place in software communities"
      
  timeline:
    - year: 1989
      did: "Wrote fascist.c to moderate newsgroup access"
    - year: 1997
      said: "Open development with no restrictions is superior"
    - year: 2015
      said: "Codes of conduct are cover for feminist attacks"
    - year: 2020
      did: "Violated OSI Code of Conduct, got banned"

fascist_c_as_prophecy: |
  In a strange way, fascist.c is a window into ESR's soul:
  - He sees the world in terms of "good guys" (wizards) vs "evil" (Mordor)
  - He believes some users are "miscreants" who should be restricted
  - He believes in hierarchical control, even while preaching freedom
  - He projects himself as Gandalf fighting Sauron
  
  The code reveals what his essays try to hide: ESR believes in control, 
  just control exercised by HIM, with HIS values determining who's "nasty."
