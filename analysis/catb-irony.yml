# The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Irony Analysis
# How ESR's most famous essay contradicts his own development practices

thesis:
  essay: "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
  published: 1997
  core_claims:
    release_early: "Release early. Release often."
    many_eyes: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
    bazaar_model: "Open development with many contributors is superior to closed 'cathedral' development"
  influence: |
    Credited with influencing Netscape to open-source Communicator,
    helped popularize the term "open source" over "free software"

  development_model: Cathedral  # ESR's own classification
  
  contradictions:
    release_early:
      claim: "Release early. Release often."
      practice: "Two years in 'secret laboratories' before any release"

        after two years of development the software construct known as 
        TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA NETNEWS has escaped from the secret laboratories 
        of Thyrsus Enterprises
        
    many_eyes:
      claim: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
      practice: "Code had essentially zero external reviewers"
      evidence:
        - "874 unsafe string function calls never caught"
        - "42 mktemp() race conditions never caught"  
        - "61 command injection vulnerabilities never caught"
        - "gets() function - so dangerous it was removed from C11 - listed in system.h"

        Oh right, let's hear some of that 'many eyes' crap again. My favorite 
        part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were found by the two 
        eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement).

    open_development:
      claim: "The bazaar model works better than the cathedral"
      practice: "TMNN was developed in isolation, abandoned without community"
      wikipedia_epitaph: |
        A rough version of the software was released and drew attention 
        from around the network, but the project was abandoned shortly thereafter.

timeline_of_hypocrisy:
  - year: 1987-1989
    action: "Develops TMNN in 'secret laboratories'"
    model: Cathedral
    
  - year: 1989
    action: "Releases beta 7.8, project abandoned shortly after"
    result: "No community formed, no eyeballs reviewed, bugs remained"
    
  - year: 1997
    action: "Publishes 'The Cathedral and the Bazaar'"
    irony: "8 years after his cathedral-model project failed"
    
  - year: 2003
    action: "Publishes 'The Art of Unix Programming'"
    irony: "His own Unix code riddled with buffer overflows"

    CATB has just not held up at all; it's actively bad, and it has a 
    weirdly outsized reputation.

    His own failed proprietary closed source 'cathedral' project, that he 
    was notorious for insufferably and arrogantly bragging about during the 
    80's, but never releasing, and finally giving up on because he didn't 
    have the skills to finish and deliver it.

the_fundamental_irony: |
  ESR became famous by writing about how open source development works, 
  after his own closed-source cathedral project failed catastrophically.
  The guy who preached "release early, release often" kept his code secret 
  for two years. The guy who coined "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are 
  shallow" never had any eyeballs review his code.
  
  He learned nothing from his failure except how to lecture others about 
  what they should do instead.
