# The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Irony Analysis
# How ESR's most famous essay contradicts his own development practices
# YAML Jazz: The comments are the actual analysis

thesis:
  essay: "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
  published: 1997
  # Eight years after TMNN died. Convenient timing.
  core_claims:
    release_early: "Release early. Release often."
    # Said the man who kept his code secret for two years
    many_eyes: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
    # Said the man whose code had zero eyeballs and infinite bugs
    bazaar_model: "Open development with many contributors is superior to closed 'cathedral' development"
    # Said the man who built a cathedral alone in his basement
  influence: |
    Credited with influencing Netscape to open-source Communicator,
    helped popularize the term "open source" over "free software"
  # He got famous telling others to do what he never did

tmnn_reality:
  development_model: Cathedral  # ESR's own classification would condemn his own project
  
  contradictions:
    release_early:
      claim: "Release early. Release often."
      practice: "Two years in 'secret laboratories' before any release"
      # "Secret laboratories" is not "release early"
      # Words mean things, Eric

        after two years of development the software construct known as 
        TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA NETNEWS has escaped from the secret laboratories 
        of Thyrsus Enterprises
      # "Escaped" - like it was a prisoner. Which it was.
        
    many_eyes:
      claim: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
      practice: "Code had essentially zero external reviewers"
      # Zero eyeballs. Maximum bugs. Shallow? Not so much.
      evidence:
        - "874 unsafe string function calls never caught"
        - "42 mktemp() race conditions never caught"  
        - "61 command injection vulnerabilities never caught"
        - "gets() function - so dangerous it was removed from C11 - listed in system.h"
      # That's a lot of bugs for zero eyeballs to miss

        Oh right, let's hear some of that 'many eyes' crap again. My favorite 
        part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were found by the two 
        eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement).

    open_development:
      claim: "The bazaar model works better than the cathedral"
      practice: "TMNN was developed in isolation, abandoned without community"
      # No bazaar. No community. Just one guy and his ego.
      wikipedia_epitaph: |
        A rough version of the software was released and drew attention 
        from around the network, but the project was abandoned shortly thereafter.

    His own failed proprietary closed source 'cathedral' project, that he 
    was notorious for insufferably and arrogantly bragging about during the 
    80's, but never releasing, and finally giving up on because he didn't 
    have the skills to finish and deliver it.
  # First-hand testimony from someone who watched the whole thing

the_fundamental_irony: |
  ESR became famous by writing about how open source development works, 
  after his own closed-source cathedral project failed catastrophically.
  The guy who preached "release early, release often" kept his code secret 
  for two years. The guy who coined "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are 
  shallow" never had any eyeballs review his code.
  
  He learned nothing from his failure except how to lecture others about 
  what they should do instead.
  
  # The real cathedral was the ego we built along the way
