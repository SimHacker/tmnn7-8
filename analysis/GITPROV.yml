  perlin_improv:
    year: 1996
    who: Ken Perlin
    what: "Improv: A System for Scripting Interactive Actors"
    url: https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/improv/
    contribution:
      - Procedural character animation
      - Behavioral scripting
      - Autonomous actors with personalities

      The Sims' Vitaboy animation system was directly inspired by Perlin's Improv.

      GitProv carries the torch:
      - Perlin's Improv: procedural CHARACTER animation
      - GitProv: procedural CHARACTER simulation
      
      We're riding on his shoulders.
