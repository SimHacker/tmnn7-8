# code-archaeology — Audit and Fix Legacy Code
# Quick scan: what, why, when
#
# REQUIRES: moollm mounted in workspace (inherits robust-first, postel)

what: |
  Read code. Find bugs. Send patches.
  OpenBFD's method: grep for patterns, read context, 
  understand buffers, apply fix, document meticulously.

why: |
  Talk is cheap. Patches are expensive.
  Everyone proposes rewrites. Nobody fixes what exists.
  The virtue is in the work, not the recognition.

when:
  - Auditing legacy C code for security issues
  - Fixing gets/sprintf/strcpy/strcat vulnerabilities
  - Documenting fixes with proper citations
  - Being the tragic hero who patches anyway

inherits:
  - OpenBFD          # The character who embodies this
  - robust-first     # Stay alive, then optimize (Ackley)
  - postel           # Liberal in, conservative out

k-lines:
  - buffer-overflow
  - gets-to-fgets
  - sprintf-to-snprintf
  - strcpy-to-strncpy
  - bounds-checking
  - man-page-citations
  - morris-worm
  - patch-attached
