# Quick scan: what, why, when

what: |
  Turn a GitHub repo into a live performance stage.
  Issues are scenes. Branches are factions. PRs are diplomatic incidents.

  Traditional code review is boring.
  Interactive performance art is memorable.
  ESR wanted many eyes. The eyes are silicon now.

when:
  - Running a satirical code archaeology project
  - Want multi-character roleplay in GitHub issues
  - Need to coordinate AI-generated content across branches
  - Building collaborative performance art with version control
