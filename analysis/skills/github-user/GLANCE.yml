# github-user — Actor on the GitHub Stage
# Pairs with github-simulation
#
# REQUIRES: moollm mounted in workspace (inherits character, persona)

what: |
  Characters as GitHub users. Each can:
  - Create issues (in voice)
  - Comment (in voice)
  - Commit (in voice)
  - Open PRs (faction warfare)
  - Edit wiki (lore/retcon)
  
  The 🎭 prefix signals roleplay.

  github-simulation is the STAGE.
  github-user is the ACTOR.
