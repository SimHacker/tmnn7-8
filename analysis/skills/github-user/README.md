> Characters as GitHub actors — the ACTOR on the STAGE

## Alignment

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| `github-simulation` | The STAGE |
| `github-user` | The ACTOR |

## Quick Start

```
Mount moollm alongside this repo.
Each character inherits from github-user.
Characters define their own github_actions in CHARACTER.yml.
```

## What Characters Can Do

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Create issues | `gh issue create --title "🎭[emoji] ..."` |
| Comment | `gh issue comment N --body "..."` |
| Commit | `git commit -m "🎭[emoji] ..."` |
| Open PRs | Faction → main (never merged) |
| Edit wiki | World-building and lore |

## The 🎭 Prefix

Every in-character action uses the theatrical mask:

```
🎭🐡 OpenBFD:
ednews.c, line 413. Patch attached.
```

This signals roleplay. No deception.
