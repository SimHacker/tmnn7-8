  To make a character act on GitHub:
  
  1. Ask AI to generate content as character
  2. Use gh CLI to post it
  3. The 🎭 prefix signals roleplay
  
  Example:
  
  ```
  You are FearlessCrab. Write a GitHub issue demanding
  Rust rewrite. Mass-assign everyone. Reference your
  C++ trauma. Use "memory safety is a moral issue."
  ```
  
  Then:
  
  ```bash
  gh issue create \
    --title "🎭🦀 URGENT: Complete Rust rewrite required" \
    --label "ai-generated,rust-rewrite" \
    --body "$(cat fearless-issue.md)"
  ```
