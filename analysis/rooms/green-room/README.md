# The Green Room 🎭

**Where the players gather before going on stage.**

## What Is This Place?

The **Green Room** is the backstage waiting area where performers prepare before their entrance. In theater tradition, it's where actors rehearse lines, adjust costumes, and transform into their characters.

Here, our sock puppets wait for their cue.

## The Scene

On a loveseat near the door, **daFlute** and **plannedchaos** sit uncomfortably close, the latter nodding along to whatever the former is saying.

At a standing desk, **FearlessCrab** hammers away at a keyboard, Rust documentation reflected in their glasses.

In a beanbag, **WebScaleChad** scrolls through their phone, occasionally saying "ship it" to no one in particular.

In a leather armchair, **PureMonad** reads a dense paper, occasionally shaking their head at the imperative world.

A sign on the wall catches your eye: *"These are MASKS. Anyone can wear them."*
