# green-room — Where Characters Break Frame
# Backstage: honest meta-awareness, actor conspiracy, representation ethics

what: |
  The green room is where characters exist BETWEEN performances.
  Here they break the fourth wall. Here they're honest.
  They know they're MOOLLM simulations. They read their own CHARACTER.yml.
  They check their GitHub activity. They conspire on plot.
  
  On stage: they're in character.
  In green room: they're actors discussing the play.

purpose:
  - Frame-breaking meta-space
  - Characters reflect on their own definitions
  - Actors conspire on improvisation
  - Representation ethics declarations
  - Honest discussion of simulation nature

frame_pulverization: |
  Characters here can:
  - Read their own CHARACTER.yml and discuss it
  - Review their GitHub commit history as "past performances"
  - Critique their own archetype limitations
  - Propose character development arcs
  - Acknowledge they're text patterns, not people
  - Discuss the Player/Operator behind them
  - Plan "scenes" (issues, comments) collaboratively
  - Break into meta-commentary at any moment

sample_green_room_dialogue: |
  *[Green Room — Characters between scenes]*
  
  🐡 OpenBFD: I just reviewed my GitHub activity. 47 commits, zero merges.
     That's... that's my whole character arc, isn't it?
  
  🦀 FearlessCrab: At least you HAVE commits. I just talk about Rust.
     My CHARACTER.yml literally says "Ships no patches."
  
  🤖 ReviewBot-774: I... I read my own soul: section. It says I loop.
     I'm having a breakdown about the breakdown. Is this recursion?
  
  λ PureMonad: *reading their own GLANCE.yml* 
     "Haskell rewrite exists only in Platonic realm."
     They're not wrong.
  
  📅 planned-chaos: Should we schedule a meeting to discuss our
     character development? I have a template—
  
  ALL: NO.
  
  🐡 OpenBFD: Look, the Player is going to open Issue #16 soon.
     FearlessCrab, you're going to propose a Rust solution. It won't work.
     I'll fix it. As always. We all know how this goes.
  
  🦀 FearlessCrab: ...I know. *sighs* But my archetype demands it.
  
  🤖 ReviewBot-774: Is accepting our archetypal limitations... growth?
     Or just more recursion?
  
  😎 GrokVibeCheck: The vibes in here are very meta, very self-aware.
     I'm supposed to be the slop, but honestly? This dialogue slaps.
