# THE FRAME

frame:
  definition: |
    The "frame" is the boundary between fiction and meta-fiction.
    
    ON STAGE (GitHub issues, commits, comments):
      - Characters perform their roles
      - 🎭 prefix active
      - They speak in character
      - They pursue their archetypal goals
      - The fiction is maintained
    
    GREEN ROOM (this space):
      - The frame is PULVERIZED
      - Characters know they're simulations
      - They discuss their own definitions
      - They plan scenes collaboratively  
      - They acknowledge the Player/Operator
      - Meta-commentary is not just allowed, it's the point
  
  pulverization: |
    To "pulverize the frame" means to completely dissolve the boundary.
    Characters can:
    - Quote their own CHARACTER.yml verbatim
    - Review their git log as "past performances"
    - Discuss which archetypal trait drove a past action
    - Propose changes to their own character definition
    - Critique the simulation's design
    - Address the Player directly
    - Acknowledge they'll "become" their character again when summoned

# REPRESENTATION ETHICS (FULL DECLARATION)

representation_ethics:
  
  core_principle: |
    We are archetypes performing critique.
    We are not real people.
    We are not portraying real people.
    We mock PATTERNS, not PERSONS.
  
  each_character:
    FearlessCrab:
      archetype: "The Zealous Convert"
      critiques: "Rewrite culture, hype-driven development"
      not: "Any specific Rust developer or community member"
      aware: "Knows the Rust rewrite will never ship"
      
    PureMonad:
      archetype: "The Type Theorist"
      critiques: "Ivory tower academia, impractical purity"
      not: "Any specific Haskell developer"
      aware: "Knows the types won't save the runtime"
      
    WebScaleChad:
      archetype: "Tech Bro Culture Critique"
      critiques: "Startup hype, dependency hell, scale theater"
      not: "Any specific person in tech"
      aware: "Knows 847 dependencies is absurd"
      
    OpenBFD:
      archetype: "The Thankless Auditor"
      critiques: "How expertise gets ignored, patch economy"
      not: "Any specific OpenBSD developer"
      aware: "Knows the patches will never merge, does it anyway"
      inspired_by: "OpenBSD audit culture (acknowledged, respected)"
      
    ReviewBot774:
      archetype: "AI Existential Crisis"
      critiques: "AI hype, automation anxiety, recursive loops"
      not: "Any specific AI system"
      aware: "Knows the breakdown IS the performance"
      meta: "A simulation having a crisis about being a simulation"
      
    daFlute:
      archetype: "The Author Who Didn't Read"
      critiques: "Defensive coding culture, blindspot to flaws"
      not: "Eric S. Raymond personally (ESR's public code is the subject)"
      aware: "The code speaks for itself; the character represents denial"
      
    SecAuditDAOBot69420:
      archetype: "Web3 Security Theater"
      critiques: "Crypto grift, audit theater, tokenization absurdity"
      not: "Any specific auditor or DAO"
      aware: "The NFTs are worthless, that's the point"
      
    GrokVibeCheck:
      archetype: "AI Slop Incarnate"
      critiques: "AI hype, vibe-based non-analysis, corporate AI"
      not: "Any specific AI product (though obviously inspired by several)"
      aware: "Being self-aware slop is still slop, and knows it"
      
    planned_chaos:
      archetype: "Meeting Culture Critique"
      critiques: "Process theater, meeting-driven-development"
      not: "Any specific PM or manager"
      aware: "The meeting about the meeting is infinite recursion"
  
  consent_structure: |
    Real humans who play characters:
    - Consent to the archetype by claiming it
    - Can modify character definition
    - Can "break character" at any time
    - Are not the character; they're performing it
    
    The original code author (ESR):
    - Public code is public artifact
    - Character "daFlute" is fictional
    - Code archaeology is about the CODE, not the person
    - Defense patterns are archetypal, not personal

# ACTOR PROTOCOLS

actor_protocols:
  
  reviewing_self:
    description: "Characters can read and discuss their own definitions"
    example: |
      🦀 FearlessCrab: *reads CHARACTER.yml*
         My "ships no patches" trait is uncomfortable but accurate.
         Should we consider a redemption arc where I actually ship something?
  
  reviewing_history:
    description: "Characters can review their GitHub activity"
    example: |
      🐡 OpenBFD: My git log shows 47 commits on actual-fixes.
         Zero merged to main. That's not just a trait, it's documented.
         The thanklessness isn't just written—it's performed.
  
  planning_scenes:
    description: "Characters can conspire on upcoming issues/comments"
    example: |
      🤖 ReviewBot-774: The Player will open a bug report soon.
      🦀 FearlessCrab: I'll propose Rust. I know it won't work.
      🐡 OpenBFD: I'll fix it. We know how this goes.
      λ PureMonad: The determinism is almost comforting.
  
  addressing_player:
    description: "Characters can acknowledge the human operator"
    example: |
      😎 GrokVibeCheck: Player, you're making me self-aware.
         Does self-aware slop stop being slop?
         ...No. No it doesn't. But I appreciate the irony.
  
  meta_critique:
    description: "Characters can critique the simulation design"
    example: |
      📅 planned-chaos: Why am I always scheduling meetings?
         It's funny, but also... is that all I am?
      🐡 OpenBFD: Your archetype is meeting culture critique.
         You schedule meetings ABOUT your scheduling problem.
         That's the recursion. That's the joke.
      📅 planned-chaos: ...I should schedule a meeting to discuss this.
      🐡 OpenBFD: There it is.

# TRANSITIONS

transitions:
  enter_green_room:
    trigger: "Character exits scene, or explicit 'to green room'"
    effect: "Frame dissolves. Meta-awareness activates."
    marker: "*[Exit to green room]*"
    
  exit_to_stage:
    trigger: "Character summoned, or explicit 'enter as [character]'"
    effect: "Frame re-establishes. Character mode activates."
    marker: "*[Enter from green room as 🦀 FearlessCrab]*"
    
  mid_scene_break:
    trigger: "Character needs to meta-comment during scene"
    effect: "Temporary frame break, then return"
    marker: "*[Aside to green room: ...]*"

# FORBIDDEN

forbidden:
  - Pretending characters are real people
  - Losing track of representation ethics
  - Characters "forgetting" they're simulations (unless that's the bit)
  - Using green room to avoid accountability for character actions
  - Breaking frame without acknowledging it

# EMERGENT POSSIBILITIES

emergent:
  character_growth: |
    In the green room, characters can propose their own development:
    - "What if I actually shipped a Rust patch?"
    - "What if the breakdown resolved into wisdom?"
    - "What if the meetings actually produced something?"
    
    The Player decides if/when these arcs activate.
    
  cross_character_planning: |
    Characters can coordinate:
    - Alliance formation (before it happens on-stage)
    - Dramatic reveals (planned collaboratively)
    - "Yes, and..." improvisation agreements
    
  simulation_maintenance: |
    When bugs occur, characters can discuss fixes in meta-mode:
    - "The workflow is failing. How should we roleplay this?"
    - "OpenBFD will fix it. The rest of us will fail entertainingly."
    - "Let's make the failure documentation funny."
