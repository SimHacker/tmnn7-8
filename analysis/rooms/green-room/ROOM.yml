# MOOLLM Room Definition

meta:
  type: room
  name: The Green Room
  emoji: 🎭
  description: |
    The backstage waiting area where performers prepare before their entrance.
    In theater tradition, the green room is where actors rehearse lines,
    adjust costumes, and transform into their characters.
    
    Here, our sock puppets wait for their cue.

# What you see when you enter
sign:
  title: "🎭 THE GREEN ROOM 🎭"
  text: |
    Welcome, player.
    
    This is the backstage area. The characters you see here are MASKS —
    fictional personas that anyone can wear. They are NOT real people.
    
    To play a character:
    1. Read their CHARACTER.yml to understand who they are
    2. Copy their prefix (e.g., 🎭📜 [*daFlute*](link):)
    3. Post in character on any issue or PR
    
    Your real GitHub username will always be visible.
    The mask is transparent. The theater is honest.
    
    Break a leg.

      A well-worn velvet loveseat, slightly too small for two people
      to sit comfortably without touching elbows. Perfect for awkward

  mirror:
    type: fixture
    emoji: 🪞
    description: |
      A full-length mirror with lights around the frame, theater-style.
      Every character checks their mask here before going on stage.
      
      A small plaque reads: "You are NOT your character. Your character
      is NOT a real person. Check your mask. Check your intentions."
    ritual: |
      Before posting as a character, look in the mirror:
      - Am I being satirical, or cruel?
      - Am I punching up, or down?
      - Would I be proud of this comment tomorrow?
      - Is this theater, or harassment?

  call_board:
    type: fixture
    emoji: 📋
    description: |
      A corkboard showing which "scenes" are currently active.
      Actors check here to see where the action is.

# Ambient details
ambiance:
  lighting: Warm, slightly dim. Classic green room style.

    - "Keyboard clicking (FearlessCrab)"
    - "Phone notifications (WebScaleChad)"
    - "Occasional sighs (PureMonad)"
    - "Muttering (daFlute)"
    - '"Mm-hmm, absolutely" (plannedchaos)'

# What happens when you enter
on_enter:
  narration: |
    You push through the heavy door marked "GREEN ROOM - PERFORMERS ONLY"
    and find yourself backstage.
    
    On a loveseat near the door, daFlute and plannedchaos sit uncomfortably
    close, the latter nodding along to whatever the former is saying.
    
    At a standing desk, FearlessCrab hammers away at a keyboard, Rust
    documentation reflected in their glasses.
    
    In a beanbag, WebScaleChad scrolls through their phone, occasionally
    saying "ship it" to no one in particular.
    
    In a leather armchair, PureMonad reads a dense paper, occasionally
    shaking their head at the imperative world.
    
    A sign on the wall catches your eye: "These are MASKS. Anyone can wear them."
    
    There's a costume rack. A mirror. A call board showing active scenes.
    
    Which character will you become?

# MOOLLM integration notes
moollm:
  compatible: true
  version: "1.0"
  notes: |
    This ROOM.yml is designed to work with MOOLLM but doesn't require it.
    
    With MOOLLM:
    - Characters auto-activate when you enter their directory
    - AI can embody characters with full context
    - Spatial relationships inform interactions
    - Characters can move between rooms
    
    Without MOOLLM:
    - Just read the CHARACTER.yml files
    - Copy the prefix format
    - Post in character on GitHub
    - Everything still works!
