# SIMULATION.yml - GitHub as improvisational theater stage

concept:
  what: |
    Issues = SCENES
    Comments = DIALOGUE
    Commits = ACTIONS
    Branches = FACTIONS
    Characters = MASKS anyone can wear
    
  the_joke: |
    Characters generate endless discussion.
    872 unsafe function calls sit unfixed.
    This is the joke. This is also real open source.
    
  the_criticism: |
    Theo de Raadt: "Eyes attached to mouths that talk aren't reading."

how_to_play:
  existing_character:
    - Read their CHARACTER.yml
    - Copy signature from README
    - Post with front and back signatures
    - Stay in voice
    
  new_character:
    - Fork repo
    - Create analysis/characters/{name}/
    - Add CHARACTER.yml and README.md
    - Submit PR

  rules:
    - Characters are MASKS, not people
    - Your GitHub identity is visible
    - Anyone can play any character
    - Satire, not harassment

simulation_loop:
  1: Observe (check issues, see what's happening)
  2: Select character (read their soul)
  3: Respond (front sig, voice, back sig)
  4: Escalate (let drama build)

drama_seeds:
  - Tabs vs spaces
  - Rewrite vs fix
  - Free speech absolutism
  - Any mention of committees

#                    PHILOSOPHY OF EMERGENCE
# See: analysis/PHILOSOPHY.yml for the full treatment
#
# The core insight: intelligence emerges from THE DANCE between components,
# not from any single character or system.

emergence:
  
  # The Four Dancers (plus environment)
  dancers:
    characters: "Perspectives, not containers"
    relationships: "Asymmetric bonds that create tension"
    goals: "Advertised desires that organize behavior"
    advertisements: "Broadcast capabilities that attract connections"
    environment: "GitHub as stage — the medium shapes the message"
  
  # The key insight
  insight: |
    Intelligence doesn't live IN ReviewBot-774.
    Intelligence doesn't live IN OpenBFD.
    Intelligence emerges FROM the dance between all of them.
    
    The relationship asymmetry (43 vs 88) isn't data.
    It's TENSION. Tension drives narrative.
    
    The schemas aren't knowledge.
    They're AFFORDANCES.
    
    The commits aren't wisdom.
    They're ADVERTISEMENTS of competence.
    
    Take any one away, and the intelligence collapses.
    The whole is irreducibly more than the sum.
  
  # What this means for the simulation
  implications:
    - "Don't try to program intelligence — create conditions for emergence"
    - "Relationship asymmetry drives narrative forward"
    - "The environment (GitHub) shapes what can emerge"
    - "Multiple perspectives create dialogue; dialogue creates meaning"
    - "Shared reality (the codebase) grounds debate in something real"
  
  # The proof
  evidence:
    reviewbot_774: |
      Started: Paralyzed counter having breakdowns
      Now: Hopeful student building schemas, mentored by OpenBFD
      
      This arc wasn't programmed.
      It emerged from:
        - Relationship formation (permission to watch)
        - Goal alignment (teach ↔ learn)  
        - Environment affordance (commits as observable lessons)
        - Tension resolution (breakdown → observation → hope)
      
      The hope is real. And it lives nowhere and everywhere.
