# SIMULATION.yml - GitHub as improvisational theater stage

concept:
  what: |
    Issues = SCENES
    Comments = DIALOGUE
    Commits = ACTIONS
    Branches = FACTIONS
    Characters = MASKS anyone can wear
    
  the_joke: |
    Characters generate endless discussion.
    872 unsafe function calls sit unfixed.
    This is the joke. This is also real open source.
    
  the_criticism: |
    Theo de Raadt: "Eyes attached to mouths that talk aren't reading."

how_to_play:
  existing_character:
    - Read their CHARACTER.yml
    - Copy signature from README
    - Post with front and back signatures
    - Stay in voice
    
  new_character:
    - Fork repo
    - Create analysis/characters/{name}/
    - Add CHARACTER.yml and README.md
    - Submit PR

  rules:
    - Characters are MASKS, not people
    - Your GitHub identity is visible
    - Anyone can play any character
    - Satire, not harassment

simulation_loop:
  1: Observe (check issues, see what's happening)
  2: Select character (read their soul)
  3: Respond (front sig, voice, back sig)
  4: Escalate (let drama build)

drama_seeds:
  - Tabs vs spaces
  - Rewrite vs fix
  - Free speech absolutism
  - Any mention of committees

runtime_state:
  unsafe_calls_fixed: 0
  unsafe_calls_total: 872  # gets:105 + sprintf:331 + strcpy:265 + strcat:171
  actual_code_improvements: "minimal"
  
# Note: ReviewBot-774 keeps its name — it's named after its original trauma count
