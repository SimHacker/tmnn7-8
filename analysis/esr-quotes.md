## On Race and IQ

### "Blacks are violent because of low IQ"

> In the U.S., blacks are 12% of the population but commit 50% of violent crimes; can anyone honestly think this is unconnected to the fact that they average 15 points of IQ lower than the general population? That stupid people are more violent is a fact independent of skin color.

### "BLM crowd too dim to train"

> The minimum level of training required to make someone effective as a self defense shooter is not very high... unfortunately, this doesn't cover the BLM crowd, which would have an average IQ of 85 if it's statistically representative of American blacks as a whole. I've never tried to train anyone that dim and wouldn't want to.

### "Haiti is full of violent idiots"

> The average IQ of the Haitian population is 67... Haiti is, quite literally, a country full of violent idiots.

### "Black Americans can't be programmers"

> what's keeping women in general from occupying the vast middle of the programming field is not general intelligence. On the other hand, the average black American has an IQ about 85 and that is pretty much a disqualifier right there. Only the cohort of their bell curve above 3 STDs from median has much hope of matching the capability of the average white programmer.

### "Police shooting black men is rational"

> Police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might be in the critical age range as though he is an near-imminent lethal threat, are being rational, not racist.

### Defending "Blacks are Lazy"

*Note: "thugs" is a well-documented dog whistle.*

## On Islam

### "Destroy Islamic culture"

> A clash of civilizations driven by the failure of Islamic/Arab culture. I think he [Steven den Beste] is also right to say that our long-term objective must be to break, crush and eventually destroy this culture, because we can't live on the same planet with people who both carry those memes and have access to weapons of mass destruction. They will hate us and seek to destroy us not for what we've done but for what we are.

### "Pork fat bullets"

> And for any agents or proxy of the regime interested in asking me questions face to face, I've got some bullets slathered in pork fat to make you feel extra special welcome.

*Context: Threatening Muslims with bullets desecrated to (in his incorrect understanding) prevent entry to heaven.*

## On Women

### The "Honeytrap" Conspiracy (2015)

ESR claimed without evidence that feminist activists were orchestrating "honeytraps" at tech conferences to frame male developers with false sexual assault allegations:

He specifically claimed Linux creator Linus Torvalds was targeted for "multiple runs" at such entrapment.

### "Sex Tips for Geeks"

ESR wrote an entire series of pickup-artist style essays including "How To Be Sexy," "The Art of the Pickup," and "On Being Good In Bed," advising geeks to:

> emit fitness-to-reproduce signals... your bulging, tumescent hacker forebrain is just not going to turn on very many women by itself

DonHopkins' assessment:
> His infamous "Sex Tips for Geeks" essay comes off like it was written by Pepé Le Pew.
