# The LICENSE: ESR's Political Manifesto in Legal Clothing

40% political screed. 60% GPL ripoff. 100% ESR.

## The Political Preamble

The license opens not with legal terms but with ESR's political philosophy — because what software license doesn't need a libertarian manifesto?

### Property Rights Absolutism

> "I support strict intellectual property laws and the right of designers to own, control, and dispose of their creative work in whatever ways and under whatever terms the free market will allow."

This is the future "open source" guy arguing for strict IP laws. Make it make sense.

### Anti-Commons

> "I oppose any and all attempts to alienate designers from their work by denying them property rights therein, including denial of the right to hold software proprietary."

The "open source" guy arguing FOR proprietary rights. The cognitive dissonance could power a small city.

### FSF Distancing

> "My action is not to be construed as an endorsement of the political or economic views or personal crusades of any member, agent, or ally of the Free Software Foundation other than myself."

He's explicitly attacking FSF while using GPL-like terms. "I'll take your license but not your cooties." Peak passive aggressive — in a software license.

### Voluntary Sharing

> "I support \*voluntary\* sharing"

Emphasis his. He added asterisks. In 1988. In a license file. The subtext: FSF's approach is "coerced sharing." Sir, this is a license file.

## Ideology in the License

ESR embeds his entire worldview into what should be a legal document.

### Free Market Evangelism

> "Believing as I do that this goal may be best accomplished within a society of private enterprise and free markets, I not only permit but encourage commercial and for-profit use of this software."

"I permit commercial use" — as if anyone was waiting for his permission.

### The Libertarian Creed

> "Please guide your use of the news software by respect for personal, political, and economic freedom; by support for natural property and contract rights; and by affirming the autonomy and privacy of individuals and voluntary associations."

A software license that asks users to adopt libertarian politics. "Accept the LICENSE terms: [x] I agree to become a libertarian."

### Censorship Absolutism

> "And, most especially, please join me in opposing unconditionally every form of and rationalization for censorship. The marketplace of ideas is, ultimately, the most important free market of all."

The irony: this is from the man who wrote `fascist.c` to control who could post. "Oppose all censorship" says man who wrote censorship tools.

## AN UNABASHED COMMERCIAL PLUG

Yes, there's an actual advertisement in the software license. He literally named the section this. Unironically.

> "I am available at competitive rates as a consultant... customized netnews versions as an information-sharing tool... don't hesitate to call."

The contact information reveals those "secret laboratories" had a street address: 22 South Warren Avenue, Malvern PA.

"Please hire me" — in a license file. No other open source license has a "COMMERCIAL PLUG" section. Because that would be tacky.

## The "Nuisance Message" Deletion

ESR modified the GPL specifically to remove the startup message requirement:

> "Only the portion that would have required the software to display a nuisance message on startup has been deleted."

His words: "nuisance message." Today we call this "credit" or "attribution." ESR calls it a "nuisance."

## The Ironies

| Statement in LICENSE | Code or Career |
|---------------------|----------------|
| "Oppose unconditionally every form of censorship" | Wrote fascist.c with FASCIST mode to control who can post |
| "Support strict intellectual property laws" | Became spokesman for "open source" |
| Denounced "denying property rights" | Wrote "The Magic Cauldron" arguing software shouldn't be property |

ESR vs ESR: the eternal struggle.
