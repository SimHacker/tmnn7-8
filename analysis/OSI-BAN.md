# OSI Ban: The Leopard Ate His Own Face

How ESR got banned from the Open Source Initiative — the organization he co-founded.

## The Setup

The Open Source Initiative was founded in 1998, co-founded by Eric S. Raymond and Bruce Perens. ESR served as president for the first six years — six years of ESR that the organization survived somehow.

Then in March 2020, ESR was banned from the OSI mailing lists.

Banned. From the thing he started. Let that sink in.

## The Incident

After 20 years of silence on the mailing lists, ESR returned on February 24, 2020. 20 years of silence. Then: "I'm back, and I have OPINIONS."

He came to argue against "ethical" open source licensing proposals that would allow projects to exclude certain organizations. His position: OSI's role is to "protect a narrow and particular set of liberties." His liberties, specifically.

His opening salvo:

> "To hell with you \*and\* the horse you rode in on."

A measured, professional opening. Very collaborative.

His penultimate email:

> "I am not fooled. You are mounting an ideological attack on our core principles of liberty and nondiscrimination. You will not succeed while I retain any ability to oppose this."

"While I retain any ability" — dramatic. Shakespearean, even.

In a blocked email that later leaked, he called someone a "toxic loonytoon." Peak discourse from the "How to Become a Hacker" guy.

## The Ban

On March 26, 2020, Pamela Chestek — Chair of the License Review Committee — announced ESR's ban for violating the OSI Code of Conduct:

- "Deliberately divisive or disrespectful messages"
- "Threatening, disparaging or belittling remarks"

His brand, basically.

The guy who hates Codes of Conduct got banned for violating one. You can't make this up.

## Hacker News Reactions

The HN thread got 328 points and 420+ comments. The internet had thoughts.

One commenter noted:

> "ESR was not banned for having the wrong opinion – many others expressed similar opinions both before and after his messages. But ESR, over the course of a few days where he returned to the mailing list, was increasingly unable to express those opinions in a professional manner."

"Increasingly unable to express opinions professionally" — diplomatic.

Another:

> "I'd even have considered banning ESR without any particular evidence. That guy isn't new to the scene but has a long history of troublesome behavior."

"Long history of troublesome behavior" — understatement of the decade.

## The Pattern

22 years from "I made this" to "you can't sit with us."

ESR co-founded an organization to promote open collaboration. ESR was banned from that organization for being unable to collaborate. The call is coming from inside the house.

This is the same pattern visible in TMNN: ESR can write about how things should work, but cannot actually work with others. His 1989 license file explicitly distanced himself from FSF, his BRAGSHEET bragged about solo "secret laboratory" work, and his code had no external contributors.

He's been like this since 1989. At least.

## The Full Pattern

ESR has been unable to maintain productive relationships with the organizations and communities he claims to represent:

- **OSI**: Banned from the organization he co-founded
- **FSF**: Explicitly distanced in 1989 TMNN license
- **Jargon File**: Maintainer but criticized by original MIT hackers
- **"Open source"**: Advocate who developed in secret laboratories

The common denominator in all of ESR's failed relationships is ESR.
