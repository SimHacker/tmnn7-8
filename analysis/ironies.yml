      My favorite part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were
      found by the two eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement).

linus_law:
  # The quote attribution problem
  claim: "Named it 'Linus's Law'"
  reality: "Linus never said it"

    ESR invented the quote himself, then attributed it to Linus Torvalds
    to borrow credibility and avoid accountability.

the_pattern:
  # The consistent behaviors
  description: |
    ESR consistently:
    1. Takes credit for ideas he didn't originate
    2. Writes about how things should work while doing the opposite
    3. Claims authority over communities that eventually reject him
    4. Embeds his political ideology into technical spaces
    5. Projects himself as a righteous wizard fighting evil

  examples:
    credit_taking:
      - "Linus's Law - Linus never said it"
      - "Jargon File - MIT community document he hijacked"

    opposite_practice:
      - "'Release early' after 2 years in secret labs"
      - "Unix best practices with 774 buffer overflows"

    community_rejection:
      - "Co-founded OSI → banned from OSI"
      - "Took over Jargon File → criticized by original hackers"

    political_embedding:
      - "FASCIST/COMMUNIST compile flags"
      - "Libertarian manifesto in LICENSE file"
      - "Jargon File rewrites"

    wizard_projection:
      - "Tolkien cosplay in fascist.c"
      - "'Gandalf' and 'Radagast' in good group"
      - "'Mordor' and 'Orthanc' as evil sites"

conclusion: |
  The TMNN source code, dormant for 30+ years, provides the archaeological
  evidence that ESR's career was built on preaching what he never practiced.
