# Archaeological Analysis

**TMNN is not a footnote. It's a Rosetta Stone.**

## The Thesis

Everything Eric S. Raymond would later become famous for — and infamous for — is already visible in this 1988 codebase.

This isn't a story of corruption by fame. This is a story of **pattern consistency.**

The code doesn't lie. The code was always here. We just finally looked.

| 1989+ | TMNN abandoned | Pattern complete |
| 1997 | "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" published | Rationalization |
| 1998 | "Open Source" term coined (with others) | Rebranding RMS's work |
| 2001 | Post-9/11 anti-Muslim rhetoric begins | Mask slipping |
| 2015 | Ejected from OSI after inflammatory posts | Pattern continues |

## The Evidence in This Repository

### 1. The BRAGSHEET

366 lines of promises. Features "coming soon." Revolutionary capabilities. The most advanced news software ever.

**Delivered:** Beta 7.8. Then silence.

This is 1988. This is before any fame, any platform, any excuse. The pattern of grandiose promises and abandoned delivery was there from the start.

### 2. The LICENSE

A software license that requires users to adopt libertarian political philosophy. In 1988.

Not content to just release software, he had to make it a *manifesto*. Had to require ideological alignment. Had to include a commercial plug for his consulting business.

The LICENSE isn't just legally eccentric. It's a personality portrait.

### 3. The fascist.c File

A content filter in a package from someone who would later crusade against "SJW censorship."

"It's just hacker jargon." "It's ironic."

It's a pattern. The rules are for other people.

### 4. The Code Quality

774 buffer overflows. `gets()` in header files. Hardcoded paths. Inconsistent style.

From the man who would write "The Art of Unix Programming."

The gap between what he preaches and what he practices was there from day one.

## A Contemporary Witness

*The following is a firsthand account from someone who was present in the 1980s hacker scene:*

> I personally thought he broke bad after 9/11 with all the Muslim stuff. But I knew he smelled bad in the 80s.
>
> He cornered me and barked about TMNN when I wanted to go elsewhere — like the cat in Pepe Le Pew, trying to escape while being relentlessly pursued by someone oblivious to social cues.
>
> I didn't realize the RMS animosity went back that far. But looking at this code, looking at this LICENSE, looking at the patterns — it all makes sense now.
>
> He was always this way. The fame just amplified it.

## The RMS Connection

ESR spent decades positioning himself as the "reasonable" alternative to Richard Stallman:

- RMS was "extreme" — ESR was "pragmatic"
- RMS was "ideological" — ESR was "business-friendly"  
- RMS was "difficult" — ESR was "the one you could work with"

The Open Source Initiative was explicitly framed as an alternative to the Free Software Foundation. "Open Source" was explicitly coined to distance from "Free Software."

But look at the 1988 LICENSE in this repository:

> *"guide your use of the news software by respect for personal, political, and economic freedom"*

Who's the ideologue again?

RMS wrote GNU. ESR wrote TMNN and abandoned it.

RMS is still maintaining his life's work. ESR is maintaining his Twitter presence.

## The Pickup Essay

For the complete picture, see ESR's writings on dating and attraction:

- [Sex Tips for Geeks](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/sextips/) — ESR's advice on "picking up women"

The same patterns appear:
- Grandiose self-assessment
- Elaborate theories
- Advice from someone who... well, read it yourself

The Pepe Le Pew comparison is apt. The relentless pursuit. The obliviousness to signals. The self-perception that doesn't match external reality.

---

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar: A Reframing

"The Cathedral and the Bazaar" is taught as a foundational text of open source philosophy.

But in light of TMNN, consider a different reading:

**The Cathedral** = How ESR actually developed software (in "secret laboratories," alone, then abandoned)

**The Bazaar** = How he told everyone else to do it (release early, release often, many eyes)

The essay wasn't a discovery. It was an aspiration he never achieved.

Or perhaps: it was marketing copy for a product he never shipped.

## Conclusion

Some people are corrupted by fame, power, or circumstances.

ESR was not corrupted. ESR was **revealed.**

This repository is the archaeological evidence. The patterns were there in 1988:

- Grandiose promises, abandoned delivery
- Ideological gatekeeping disguised as principles  
- "Ironic" behavior that isn't ironic at all
- Taking credit, avoiding accountability
- The gap between preaching and practice
- The relentless self-promotion
- The pursuit that doesn't notice it's unwelcome

The Cathedral and the Bazaar wasn't a revelation. It was a rationalization.

He didn't discover open source principles. He discovered how to monetize the movement RMS built.

**The code doesn't lie. The code was always here. We just finally looked.**

## To ESR

If you're reading this:

You spent decades saying "show me the code." We did.

You said "many eyes make all bugs shallow." The eyes are here.

You said the internet never forgets. It doesn't.

You said you have the right to be rude. So do we.

You proposed that codes of conduct should be one sentence: *"If you are more annoying to work with than your contributions justify, you'll be ejected."*

By your own standard, applied to your own conduct, documented with your own words:

**You failed your own test.**

You spent decades trying to marginalize Richard Stallman — the man who actually wrote the code, who actually built the movement, who actually sacrificed for his principles.

You called him difficult. Extreme. Socially awkward. Bad for the brand.

You wanted to be the face of open source. The reasonable one. The one corporations could trust.

How did that work out?

RMS is still maintaining GNU. You're still maintaining... your blog.

TMNN: abandoned.  
Fetchmail: mass-resigned by maintainers.  
Your reputation: self-immolated.

You weren't the reasonable alternative to RMS.

You were the warning about what happens when ego exceeds output.

---

*"The truth is always embarrassing to somebody."*

— You said that. You were right.
