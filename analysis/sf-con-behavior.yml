    description: |
      Eric S. Raymond (aka "Eric The Flute" or "ESR") spent the late 1980s 
      obsessively promoting his "Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews" (TMNN) project 
      at science fiction conventions... He would corner people and drone on 
      endlessly about it at inappropriate times.

      His own failed proprietary closed source 'cathedral' project, that he 
      was notorious for insufferably and arrogantly bragging about during the 
      80's, but never releasing, and finally giving up on because he didn't 
      have the skills to finish and deliver it, and nobody wanted to collaborate 
      with him or listen to him talk about it any more.

the_bragsheet:
  file: doc/BRAGSHEET
  tone: |
    The BRAGSHEET reads like convention patter - exactly the kind of 
    self-promotional material ESR would have used at SF cons.
    
  opening_line: |
    after two years of development the software construct known as 
    TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA NETNEWS has escaped from the secret laboratories 
    of Thyrsus Enterprises
    
  grandiose_claims:
    - "secret laboratories"
    - "software construct" (dramatic language)
    - "Thyrsus Enterprises" (his consulting company, made to sound impressive)

      - "distributed hypertext service"

    Infinite hours of talking about TMNN vs. zero delivered features

the_pattern:
  talking_vs_doing: |
    ESR's career shows a consistent pattern: more talking than doing.
    - TMNN: Two years of bragging, then abandonment
    - CATB: Famous essay about development, but no famous software
    - Jargon File: Took over someone else's work
    - OSI: Co-founded it, eventually banned from it
    
  sf_con_culture: |
    Science fiction conventions were (and are) gathering places for tech-adjacent 
    people. In the 1980s, before the web, they were key networking venues. 
    ESR used them as captive audiences for self-promotion.
