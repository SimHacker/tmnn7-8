tmnn_era_testimony:
  key_quote: |
    Eric S. Raymond (aka "Eric The Flute" or "ESR") spent the late 1980s 
    obsessively promoting his "Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews" (TMNN) project 
    at science fiction conventions, calling himself the "mad mastermind of 
    TMN-Netnews" in his usenet signature (comp.lang.misc, December 13, 1989). 
    He would corner people and drone on endlessly about it at inappropriate times.

  detailed_description: |
    His own failed proprietary closed source 'cathedral' project, that he was 
    notorious for insufferably and arrogantly bragging about during the 80's, 
    but never releasing, and finally giving up on because he didn't have the 
    skills to finish and deliver it, and nobody wanted to collaborate with him 
    or listen to him talk about it any more.

        Real hackers from the MIT-AI lab where it originated consider his 
        revisionist politically slanted rewriting-for-profit of the Hacker's 
        Dictionary to be disrespectful parasitical vandalism that doesn't 
        represent the actual hacker culture, just a tool he hijacked, corrupted, 
        and abused to spread his right-wing political ideology.

        He certainly doesn't deserve to be called a hacker, let alone presume

linus_law_testimony:
  key_quote: |
    He made up the ridiculous 'many eyes' quote himself, then misnamed it 
    'Linus's Law' to avoid personal responsibility and shift the blame to 
    innocent Linus Torvalds, who never said such a stupid thing.

      In the U.S., blacks are 12% of the population but commit 50% of violent 
      crimes; can anyone honestly think this is unconnected to the fact that 
      they average 15 points of IQ lower than the general population? That 
      stupid people are more violent is a fact independent of skin color.

  quotes:
    - |
      I'm totally unconvinced that Eric "The Flute" Raymond represents or 
      speaks for the 'hacker community'. For one thing, very few people I 
      know of in the hacker community are as racist as ESR.

      (Also by the way, children and nice people read Hacker News, so please 
      do not link to ESR's reprehensible web site, promote his racist ideology, 
      or buy into his bullshit that he is a hacker or speaks for hackers.)

open_source_criticism:
  date: 2014-10-06
  context: 'Discussion of "Open Source is awful"'
  key_quote: |
    The thing that is awful about "Open Source" is that it was a term coined 
    by Eric S Raymond in order to attack Richard Stallman and the Free 
    Software Foundation, and to make a name and money for himself as a 
    so-called "hacker", without actually having to write any useful code, 
    or even read anybody else's code and report bugs with his very own 
    "millions of I's".

      quote: |
        Autohagiography with some programming tips... The writing style of 
        this book tends to hurt the reading experience, as Raymond trumpets 
        his own minor achievements in the free software community.
    bill_joy_review:
      quote: |
        ESR's theory and ideology is ridiculously flawed with misappropriated 
        valuations. This is, yet another advocacy campaign for gnu/Linux, 
        mixed in with a UNIX context.
    lacking_code:
      quote: |
        If you expect to see any code, you'll be disappointed. The author 
        gives ample examples, but mostly preaching the Unix philosophy or 
        religion.
  donhopkins_analysis: |
    Everything he writes is deeply tainted with his one-sided partisan 
    ideology and narcissistic self promotion, which is not just limited 
    to Microsoft bashing, but to extreme right wing libertarian politics 
    and guns. You can see that by the changes he made to the "Hacker's 
    Dictionary", and you can see that in everything else he writes.

climategate_testimony:
  context: "ESR's failed attempt to discredit climate scientists"
  quote: |
    The little experience Raymond DOES have auditing code has been a total 
    fiasco and embarrassing failure, since his understanding of the code 
    was incompetent and deeply tainted by his preconceived political ideology 
    and conspiracy theories about global warming, which was his only 
    motivation for auditing the code in the first place. His sole quest 
    was to discredit the scientists who warned about global warming. The 
    code he found and highlighted was actually COMMENTED OUT, and he never 
    addressed the fact that the scientists were vindicated.
