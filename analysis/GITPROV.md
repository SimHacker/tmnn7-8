# GitProv

**Git + Improv = GitProv**

*Multi-user real-time collaborative performance art, in the spirit of Engelbart's NLS.*

## The Lineage

### Ken Perlin's Improv (1996)

The name "GitProv" carries a double meaning.

**Ken Perlin** created [Improv](https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/improv/) — a system for scripting interactive actors with procedural animation and autonomous behavior.

The Sims' **Vitaboy** animation system was directly inspired by Perlin's Improv. Don Hopkins worked on The Sims. The connection is direct.

| Perlin's Improv (1996) | GitProv (2026) |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Procedural character *animation* | Procedural character *simulation* |
| Behavioral scripting | CHARACTER.yml |
| Autonomous actors | AI-driven characters |
| Real-time performance | Real-time GitHub threads |

**We're riding on his shoulders.**

### Bar Karma (2011)

Will Wright's revolutionary experiment on Current TV (Al Gore's network).

> *"What if the audience could rewrite the show while it's happening?"* — Will Wright

Television's **first crowd-sourced scripted series**:
- Audiences wrote episodes using the **Storymaker tool**
- Community voted on story directions  
- Professional cast filmed the winning scripts

### Don Hopkins at Stupid Fun Club

- Built the iPhone app and Storymaker tech
- Developed **Urban Safari** — GPS-based mobile storytelling
- Integrated with **Layar** AR app (Amsterdam company — Don worked with their people at TomTom)
- Location-aware narratives: stories triggered by physical location

### The GitHub Evolution

| Bar Karma (2011) | GitHub Simulation (2026) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Storymaker tool | CHARACTER.yml + Cursor |
| Community submissions | GitHub Issues and comments |
| Voting on story direction | Reactions + audience participation |
| Professional execution | AI + human performers |
| Current TV as platform | GitHub as platform |
| Episodes as output | Threads and running software (or not) as output |

## Storymaker Lives. Urban Safari Lives.

The tools didn't die when Current TV shut down.

**Storymaker** — the community story creation tool — lives here:
- `CHARACTER.yml` is a story element template
- GitHub Issues are story submissions
- Reactions are community votes
- The thread IS the episode

**Urban Safari** — GPS-based collaborative storytelling — lives here:
- The repo is the territory
- Directories are locations
- Characters inhabit spaces
- The audience explores and contributes

## The Git Repo IS The Branching Script

Storymaker needed custom software to manage branching narratives.

**Git already does this. It was built for it.**

| Storymaker Feature | Git Equivalent |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Branching storylines | `git branch` |
| Timeline management | Commit history |
| Story versioning | `git log` |
| Parallel narratives | Multiple branches |
| Merging storylines | `git merge` |
| Community review | Pull Request review |
| Voting on direction | PR approvals + reactions |
| Reverting bad choices | `git revert` |
| Tagging key moments | `git tag` |
| Forking the canon | `git fork` |

**Git IS collaborative storytelling infrastructure.** We just never used it that way.

Every feature Linus built for managing Linux kernel patches is a feature for managing branching narratives. The tooling is identical. The use case is new.

## The Engelbart Connection

Doug Engelbart's NLS (1968) demonstrated:
- Multi-user real-time collaboration
- Shared workspaces
- Version control concepts
- Augmented human intellect through tools

**GitHub is NLS for the masses.** And this is what happens when you use it for theater instead of code.

## GitProv

**Git + Improv = GitProv**

The hummingbird landed. 🎯

### Better Than Podcasting

| Term | Portmanteau | Direction |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Podcasting** | iPod + Broadcasting | One-way. You listen. |
| **GitProv** | Git + Improv | **Two-way. You participate.** |

Podcasting democratized *distribution*.

GitProv democratizes *creation*.

Everyone's a performer. Everyone's a writer. The audience IS the cast.

**Podcasting made everyone a broadcaster.**
**GitProv makes everyone an improviser.**
