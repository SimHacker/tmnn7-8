## TMNN Era Testimony

### The Convention Droning

> Eric S. Raymond (aka "Eric The Flute" or "ESR") spent the late 1980s obsessively promoting his "Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews" (TMNN) project at science fiction conventions, calling himself the "mad mastermind of TMN-Netnews" in his usenet signature (comp.lang.misc, December 13, 1989). He would corner people and drone on endlessly about it at inappropriate times.

### The Failure

> His own failed proprietary closed source 'cathedral' project, that he was notorious for insufferably and arrogantly bragging about during the 80's, but never releasing, and finally giving up on because he didn't have the skills to finish and deliver it, and nobody wanted to collaborate with him or listen to him talk about it any more.

### The Last Straw

> The last straw was probably his intensely sour body odor and lack of hygiene the last time he cornered me at a science fiction convention in the 1980's to relentlessly yap about his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle NetNews Reader.

## On "Linus's Law"

> He made up the ridiculous 'many eyes' quote himself, then misnamed it 'Linus's Law' to avoid personal responsibility and shift the blame to innocent Linus Torvalds, who never said such a stupid thing.

## On The Jargon File

> Real hackers from the MIT-AI lab where it originated consider his revisionist politically slanted rewriting-for-profit of the Hacker's Dictionary to be disrespectful parasitical vandalism that doesn't represent the actual hacker culture, just a tool he hijacked, corrupted, and abused to spread his right-wing political ideology.

> He certainly doesn't deserve to be called a hacker, let alone presume to define the meaning of the term.

## On "Sex Tips for Geeks"

> His infamous "Sex Tips for Geeks" essay comes off like it was written by Pepé Le Pew.

## On ESR's Code Quality

> The code ESR has written himself is mediocre and lackluster at best, and trivial and unimportant in comparison to RMS's.

## On "Open Source"

> The thing that is awful about "Open Source" is that it was a term coined by Eric S Raymond in order to attack Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, and to make a name and money for himself as a so-called "hacker", without actually having to write any useful code, or even read anybody else's code and report bugs with his very own "millions of I's".

## On ESR's Climate Code "Audit"

> The little experience Raymond DOES have auditing code has been a total fiasco and embarrassing failure, since his understanding of the code was incompetent and deeply tainted by his preconceived political ideology and conspiracy theories about global warming, which was his only motivation for auditing the code in the first place. His sole quest was to discredit the scientists who warned about global warming. The code he found and highlighted was actually COMMENTED OUT, and he never addressed the fact that the scientists were vindicated.

## External Recognition

Others on Hacker News recognize DonHopkins as the authoritative ESR critic:

> "Eric S. Raymond (yes, that ESR; insert long-winded DonHopkins rant, extensively cross-referenced to his own USENET and UNIX-HATERS mailing list postings, about what a horrible person 'Eric the Flute' is)..."
