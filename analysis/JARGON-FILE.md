# The Jargon File: Hostile Takeover of a Community Treasure

How ESR hijacked hacker culture.

## The Original

The Jargon File began at Stanford AI Lab in 1975 — before ESR, back when it was pure. Raphael Finkel started it. Mark Crispin brought it to MIT in 1976. Guy L. Steele Jr. — actual legend, wrote LISP standards — was a major contributor and editor. Richard M. Stallman — another actual legend, started GNU — contributed at the MIT AI Lab.

Notice who's not on this list? ESR.

In 1983, Guy Steele edited an authorized compilation published by Harper & Row as "The Hacker's Dictionary" — a book by *actual* MIT/Stanford hackers. "Actual" — a distinction that matters.

## The Takeover

In the late 1980s, ESR took over maintenance of the stagnant Jargon File. Vulture circles, lands on unattended carcass.

His version became "The New Hacker's Dictionary" — "New" as in "I changed it" — with editions in 1991 and 1996, now hosted at catb.org/~esr/jargon/.

## The Accusations

**Maciej Ceglowski** (Pinboard founder, brilliant writer):

> "It would be great if someone with appropriate 'back in the day' credentials would take over membership of this document and powerwash the gratuitous Eric Raymond edits and insertions off of it."

"Powerwash the gratuitous Eric Raymond edits" — chef's kiss.

**deepspace** (Hacker News):

> "The man's disgusting political and social views tarnished everything he touched."

"Tarnished everything he touched" — the Midas touch, but bad.

**DonHopkins** (knew ESR since early 1980s, was present at MIT AI Lab):

> "Real hackers from the MIT-AI lab where it originated consider his revisionist politically slanted rewriting-for-profit of the Hacker's Dictionary to be disrespectful parasitical vandalism that doesn't represent the actual hacker culture, just a tool he hijacked, corrupted, and abused to spread his right-wing political ideology."

"Disrespectful parasitical vandalism" — accurate.

> "He certainly doesn't deserve to be called a hacker, let alone presume to define the meaning of the term."

The guy who rewrote the hacker dictionary isn't a hacker.

## The Original Source

The original MIT ITS jargon file — free of ESR's pollution — is preserved at:
https://github.com/PDP-10/its/blob/master/doc/humor/jargon.68

"Free of ESR's pollution" — liberation theology.

## What ESR Changed

**Additions:**
- Political content reflecting ESR's libertarian views
- Self-referential entries promoting ESR's own work ("See also: my essays, my books, my genius")
- Redefinitions that changed the meaning of hacker culture

**Removals/Diminishments:**
- Original MIT/Stanford cultural context
- Contributions from people ESR disagreed with (if you're not on Team ESR, you get edited out)

**Net Effect:** Transformed a collaborative community document into a vehicle for ESR's personal ideology and self-promotion. Turned "our history" into "my resume."

## The Pattern

ESR has a recurring pattern:

1. Finding something created by others
2. Taking it over during a period of inactivity
3. Rewriting it to reflect his views
4. Publishing it as if it represents the original community
5. Profiting from and claiming credit for others' work

The Jargon File is the clearest example, but see also:
- His claims about defining "hacker" culture
- "How to Become a Hacker" essay
- "Linus's Law" (attributed to someone who never said it)

It's not a pattern — it's a business model.

## Parallel to TMNN

In TMNN, ESR took Eugene Spafford's `fascist.c` code and "rewrote" it, adding his political ideology (FASCIST/COMMUNIST flags) and buffer overflows.

Spafford: security legend.  
ESR: added security vulnerabilities.

The pattern is consistent: take others' work, insert politics, break things, claim credit.

The audacity.
