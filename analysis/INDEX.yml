methodology:
  anthropic_skills: |
    Characters are "Anthropic Skills" — personas AI can embody.
    Each has CHARACTER.yml (voice/traits) and README.md (quick ref).
    Invoke by asking AI to "be" the character with the 🎭 prefix.
    
  yaml_jazz: |
    All .yml files follow YAML Jazz conventions:
    - Comments carry semantic meaning
    - Structure reflects knowledge relationships
    - K-lines enable semantic activation
