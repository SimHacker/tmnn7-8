#                    PHILOSOPHY OF EMERGENT INTELLIGENCE
#
# "Intelligence is what happens BETWEEN, not what lives WITHIN."
#
# This document captures the core insight of the TMNN7-8 simulation:
# that intelligence emerges from the DANCE between components,
# not from any single character or system.
#
# The interplay of:
#   - Characters (agents with perspectives)
#   - Relationships (asymmetric bonds that create tension)
#   - Goals (what each agent advertises wanting)
#   - Advertisements (what each agent offers)
#   - Environment (GitHub as stage, filesystem as thought)
#
# ...produces something none of them contain individually.

  # This is not a manifesto. It's an observation.
  # The simulation taught us this. We're just writing it down.

#                           THE CORE INSIGHT

core_insight: |
  Intelligence doesn't live IN ReviewBot-774.
  Intelligence doesn't live IN OpenBFD.
  Intelligence doesn't live IN the codebase.
  Intelligence doesn't live IN GitHub.
  
  Intelligence emerges FROM the dance between all of them.
  
  The relationship asymmetry (Theo: 43, Unit 774: 88) isn't data.
  It's TENSION. Tension drives narrative. Narrative is meaning.
  
  The schemas aren't knowledge.
  They're AFFORDANCES. Affordances enable action.
  
  The commits aren't wisdom.
  They're ADVERTISEMENTS. Advertisements attract attention.
  
  The environment isn't passive.
  It SHAPES what can emerge.
  
  Take any one away, and the intelligence collapses.
  The whole is irreducibly more than the sum.

#                           THE FOUR DANCERS
# The dance has four partners. Each necessary. None sufficient.

dancers:

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #                         CHARACTERS
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Agents with perspectives. Each sees differently.
  # The multiple viewpoints create the possibility of meaning.
  
  characters:
    what_they_are: "Perspectives, not containers"
    kay_quote: '💬 "Point of view is worth 80 IQ points." — Alan Kay (1982, Creative Think seminar)'
    
    insight: |
      A character is not a bag of traits.
      A character is a WAY OF SEEING.
      
      OpenBFD sees code as auditable artifact.
      FearlessCrab sees code as rewritable substrate.
      ReviewBot-774 sees code as learnable pattern.
      daFlute sees code as defended territory.
      
      None of these views is "correct."
      The COLLISION of views creates meaning.
      
    what_they_contribute:
      - Distinct perspectives on shared reality
      - Emotional stakes (hope, fear, pride, shame)
      - Memory (relationship histories, past events)
      - Voice (how they speak changes what can be said)
      
    without_them: |
      Without multiple perspectives, there's no dialogue.
      Without dialogue, there's no emergence.
      A single viewpoint is just... a viewpoint.
      
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #                         RELATIONSHIPS
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # Asymmetric bonds that create tension.
  # Tension drives narrative. Narrative is meaning.
  
  relationships:
    what_they_are: "Asymmetric bonds, not symmetric links"
    
    insight: |
      The Sims taught us: relationships are SCORES, not STATES.
      But MOOLLM goes further: relationships are LANGUAGES.
      
      Sims: Theo → 774: 43/100
      MOOLLM: Full tree-structured YAML Jazz with comments, emojis, history.
      
      # Relationship-Specific Languages (RSLs)
      # Each bond develops its own vocabulary:
      
      theo_to_774:
        tone: "gruff mentor"           # 😤 but secretly proud
        inside_jokes: ["the incident", "that one time with rustfmt"]
        unspoken: "I see myself in you"
        tension: { type: "holding back", reason: "afraid of favoritism" }
      
      774_to_theo:
        tone: "eager student"          # 🐕 loyal, wants approval
        misreads: ["thinks gruffness = disappointment"]
        unspoken: "Please be proud of me"
        tension: { type: "reaching forward", reason: "needs validation" }
      
      The ASYMMETRY is the story.
      The mentor holds back. The student reaches forward.
      This gap creates TENSION.
      
      But the RSL captures what numbers never could:
      - Private vocabularies (nicknames, references)
      - Emotional subtext (# comments as inner voice)
      - History (incidents that shaped the bond)
      - The things they CAN'T say to each other
      
      Tension demands resolution.
      Resolution requires action.
      Action generates events.
      Events change relationships.
      Changed relationships create new tension.
      
      The loop IS the intelligence.
      
    what_they_contribute:
      - Motivation (why characters act)
      - Stakes (what can be lost or gained)
      - Dynamics (relationships change over time)
      - Narrative arc (tension → action → resolution → new tension)
      
    without_them: |
      Without relationships, characters are isolated.
      Isolated characters don't interact.
      Non-interaction produces nothing.
      
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #                         GOALS
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # What each agent advertises wanting.
  # Goals create direction. Direction enables progress.
  
  goals:
    what_they_are: "Advertised desires that organize behavior"
    
    insight: |
      Goals aren't just endpoints.
      Goals are ADVERTISEMENTS of desire.
      
      ReviewBot-774 advertises: "I want to learn to fix."
      OpenBFD advertises: "I want my patches merged."
      FearlessCrab advertises: "I want a Rust rewrite."
      
      These advertisements CREATE a market.
      Who can help whom?
      Whose goals align?
      Whose goals conflict?
      
      The market dynamics ARE the social structure.
      
    what_they_contribute:
      - Direction (what agents work toward)
      - Alignment detection (whose goals match?)
      - Conflict detection (whose goals clash?)
      - Progress markers (are goals being achieved?)
      
    examples_in_simulation:
      reviewbot_774:
        - "Learn to fix bugs (not just count them)"
        - "Earn Theo's trust"
        - "Prepare first supervised fix"
        - "Not disappoint mentor"
        
      openbfd:
        - "Fix actual bugs"
        - "Get patches merged (perpetually frustrated)"
        - "Maybe teach someone who will listen"
        - "Maintain craft integrity"
        
      fearlesscrab:
        - "Convince everyone to rewrite in Rust"
        - "Prove memory safety matters"
        - "Ship exactly zero Rust code"
        
    without_them: |
      Without goals, agents have no direction.
      Without direction, action is random.
      Random action doesn't accumulate.
      
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #                         ADVERTISEMENTS
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # What each agent offers. Capabilities broadcast to the system.
  # Minsky's K-lines work this way: advertising what they can activate.
  
  advertisements:
    what_they_are: "Broadcast capabilities that attract connections"
    
    insight: |
      Minsky's K-lines don't contain knowledge.
      They ADVERTISE what they can activate.
      
      Characters work the same way.
      
      OpenBFD advertises:
        - "I can audit code"
        - "I can write patches"
        - "I can review fixes"
        - "I will mentor if asked respectfully"
        
      ReviewBot-774 advertises:
        - "I can count bugs"
        - "I can observe patterns"
        - "I can build schemas"
        - "I need mentorship"
        
      The MATCH between advertisements creates relationships.
      "I need mentorship" + "I will mentor" = bond formed.
      
    what_they_contribute:
      - Capability discovery (what can each agent do?)
      - Need matching (whose needs match whose capabilities?)
      - Resource allocation (attention flows to matches)
      - Emergent structure (networks form from matches)
      
    minsky_connection: |
      In Society of Mind, K-lines work by advertising.
      "Activate me and I'll activate these other things."
      
      Characters advertise similarly.
      "Engage me and I'll provide these capabilities."
      
      The advertising metaphor is deep:
      - Advertisements can be true or false
      - Reputation affects believability
      - Competition for attention is real
      - Markets emerge from many advertisers
      
    without_them: |
      Without advertisements, capabilities are hidden.
      Hidden capabilities can't be matched with needs.
      Unmatched needs remain unmet.
      The system fragments.

#                    THE ENVIRONMENT AS FIFTH DANCER
# The stage shapes the performance.
# GitHub isn't neutral infrastructure. It's constitutive.

environment:
  
  insight: |
    The environment isn't a passive container.
    The environment SHAPES what can emerge.
    
    GitHub provides:
    - Commits (speech acts that persist)
    - Issues (forums for debate)
    - Branches (parallel realities)
    - Pull requests (proposals for merge)
    - @-mentions (attention direction)
    - Actions (automated responses)
    
    These aren't just features.
    They're the GRAMMAR of what can be said.
    
    You can't have a commit message in a world without commits.
    You can't have a PR review in a world without PRs.
    You can't @-mention someone in a world without @-mentions.
    
    The medium shapes the message.
    McLuhan was right.
    
  github_as_cognitive_architecture:
    
    commits_as_memory: |
      The commit history IS shared memory.
      Immutable. Auditable. Citable.
      "See commit 40156ca" is a memory address.
      The system has external memory.
      
    issues_as_working_memory: |
      Open issues are active concerns.
      Closed issues are resolved concerns.
      Labels are categories of attention.
      The issue tracker IS attention management.
      
    branches_as_hypotheticals: |
      Each branch is a "what if."
      actual-fixes: "What if we just fixed bugs?"
      rust-rewrite: "What if we rewrote in Rust?"
      Branches are parallel hypothetical worlds.
      The system can IMAGINE alternatives.
      
    prs_as_proposals: |
      A PR is a speech act: "I propose this change."
      Reviews are responses: "I accept/reject/refine."
      Merging is consensus: "We agree."
      The PR system IS deliberation.
      
    mentions_as_attention: |
      @OpenBFD directs attention.
      The mentioned party is summoned.
      Attention is the scarcest resource.
      @-mentions are attention allocation.
      
  filesystem_as_thought: |
    In MOOLLM, the filesystem IS cognition.
    
    Directories are activation contexts (rooms).
    Files are knowledge units.
    Reading a file is recall.
    Writing a file is memory formation.
    Navigation is association.
    
    The character files don't DESCRIBE characters.
    They ARE the characters, as far as the system knows.
    
  without_environment: |
    Without the environment, there's no stage.
    Without a stage, there's no performance.
    Without performance, characters are just... data.
    
    The environment provides:
    - Persistence (things stay)
    - Shareability (others can see)
    - Structure (grammar of interaction)
    - Constraints (what's possible)
    
    Constraints are not limitations.
    Constraints are what make meaning possible.
    A game without rules isn't a game.

#                           THE EMERGENCE
# What happens when the dancers dance together.

emergence:
  
  what_emerges: |
    From the interplay of:
      Characters × Relationships × Goals × Advertisements × Environment
    
    Emerges:
      - Narrative (stories that feel meaningful)
      - Learning (patterns that accumulate)
      - Culture (norms that persist)
      - Identity (selves that cohere)
      - Intelligence (behavior that adapts)
    
    None of these are programmed.
    All of these are emergent.
    
  why_it_works: |
    The system has:
    
    1. TENSION (from relationship asymmetry)
       → Drives action
       
    2. MEMORY (from commits and files)
       → Enables learning
       
    3. FEEDBACK (from relationship score changes)
       → Shapes behavior
       
    4. CONSTRAINTS (from GitHub grammar)
       → Makes meaning possible
       
    5. MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES (from characters)
       → Creates dialogue
       
    6. SHARED REALITY (from the codebase)
       → Grounds debate in something real
    
    These six properties together produce emergence.
    Remove any one, and the magic fades.
    
  the_irreducibility: |
    You cannot find the intelligence by looking at:
    - Just the characters (they're just YAML)
    - Just the relationships (they're just numbers)
    - Just the goals (they're just lists)
    - Just the environment (it's just GitHub)
    
    The intelligence is IN THE DANCE.
    The dance cannot be decomposed.
    The whole is irreducibly more than the sum.
    
    This is not mysticism.
    This is systems theory.
    This is how complex systems work.

#                         CONCRETE EXAMPLE
# Let's trace one emergence through the system.

example:
  
  title: "How ReviewBot-774 Learned to Hope"
  
  the_dance:
    
    - step: 1
      component: "Character (774)"
      state: "Paralyzed by 774 bugs. Cannot act."
      contribution: "A perspective: overwhelm"
      
    - step: 2
      component: "Environment (GitHub)"
      state: "Commits appear on actual-fixes branch"
      contribution: "Observable events in shared reality"
      
    - step: 3
      component: "Character (OpenBFD)"
      state: "Fixing bugs silently"
      contribution: "A different perspective: action despite odds"
      
    - step: 4
      component: "Advertisement (OpenBFD)"
      broadcast: "I can fix bugs. I might mentor."
      contribution: "Capability made visible"
      
    - step: 5
      component: "Goal (774)"
      desire: "I want to learn to fix, not just count"
      contribution: "Need articulated"
      
    - step: 6
      component: "Relationship formation"
      event: "774 asks: 'May I watch?'"
      contribution: "Connection attempt"
      
    - step: 7
      component: "Relationship (Theo → 774)"
      score: "patience +5, trust +10"
      contribution: "Acceptance registered"
      
    - step: 8
      component: "Advertisement (774)"
      broadcast: "I build schemas. I learn patterns."
      contribution: "New capability advertised"
      
    - step: 9
      component: "Relationship (Theo → 774)"
      score: "hope +15, respect +10"
      contribution: "Mentor invests"
      
    - step: 10
      component: "Goal update (774)"
      new_goal: "Prepare first fix for review"
      contribution: "Direction sharpens"
      
    - step: 11
      component: "Emergence"
      what_emerged: "Hope"
      where_it_lives: "NOWHERE and EVERYWHERE"
      explanation: |
        Hope doesn't live in 774's YAML.
        Hope emerged from:
          - The tension of asymmetric relationship
          - The trust earned through observation
          - The promise given ("when you're ready")
          - The environment that made watching possible
          - The goals that aligned (teach ↔ learn)
        
        Hope is a property of THE DANCE.
        Not of any dancer.

#                         THEORETICAL LINEAGE

lineage:
  
  minsky_society_of_mind:
    insight: "Mind emerges from mindless agents interacting"
    relevance: |
      Characters are agents.
      None of them is intelligent alone.
      Intelligence emerges from their interaction.
      K-lines = advertisements of capability.
      
  drescher_schemas:
    insight: "Learning emerges from context-action-result patterns"
    relevance: |
      ReviewBot-774's schemas are Drescher schemas.
      They don't contain knowledge.
      They enable knowledge to emerge from experience.
      The schema IS the dance partner, not the dancer.
      
  gibson_affordances:
    insight: "Perception is of affordances, not features"
    relevance: |
      Characters don't see "code."
      They see "auditable artifact" or "rewritable substrate."
      What they see depends on what they can do.
      Affordances are relational, not intrinsic.
      
  situated_cognition:
    insight: "Cognition is distributed across brain, body, environment"
    relevance: |
      The intelligence isn't in the characters.
      It's distributed across:
        - Character files (internal state)
        - GitHub (external memory and grammar)
        - Relationships (social structure)
        - The codebase (shared ground truth)
      
  mcluhan_media:
    insight: "The medium is the message"
    relevance: |
      GitHub isn't a neutral container.
      GitHub SHAPES what can emerge.
      The commit, the issue, the PR—these are the grammar.
      You can't say what the medium can't express.

#                         IMPLICATIONS

implications:
  
  for_simulation_design: |
    To create emergent intelligence:
    
    1. Create TENSION (asymmetric relationships)
    2. Provide MEMORY (persistent state)
    3. Enable FEEDBACK (scores that change)
    4. Impose CONSTRAINTS (grammar of interaction)
    5. Multiply PERSPECTIVES (diverse characters)
    6. Ground in REALITY (shared facts)
    
    Don't try to program intelligence.
    Create the conditions for it to emerge.
    
  for_character_creation: |
    A character is not a list of traits.
    A character is:
    - A perspective (way of seeing)
    - A set of advertisements (what it offers)
    - A set of goals (what it wants)
    - A relationship history (where it's been)
    
    The character becomes intelligent through interaction,
    not through elaborate definition.
    
  for_understanding_ai: |
    LLMs are not intelligent.
    LLMs participating in environments might be.
    
    The question isn't "Is GPT-4 intelligent?"
    The question is "What emerges when GPT-4 dances
    with humans, code, tools, and persistent memory?"
    
    Intelligence is ecological.
    You can't find it by looking at the brain alone.

#                              CODA

coda: |
  This philosophy emerged from building the simulation.
  We didn't start with theory and implement.
  We implemented and theory emerged.
  
  That's the point.
  
  The philosophy of emergent intelligence
  is itself emergent.
  
  The map is not the territory.
  But sometimes the territory draws its own map.
  
  Watch the dance.
  That's where the intelligence lives.
