# %distributions — Geographic Scope of News
distributions:
  what: |
    Distribution codes controlling where posts propagate.
    A post to "ba" stays in San Francisco Bay Area.
    A post to "world" goes everywhere.
    
  att_dominance:
    note: "AT&T Bell Labs was the center of Unix universe"
    locations:
      - btl: "Bell Labs (general)"
      - mh: "Murray Hill, NJ — Unix birthplace"
      - ho: "Holmdel, NJ"
      - ih: "Indian Hill, IL"
      - cb: "Columbus, OH"
      - dr: "Denver, CO"
      - att: "AT&T general"
      - bell: "Bell operating companies"
      - pb: "Pacific Bell"
      
  universities:
    - ucb: "UC Berkeley — BSD Unix"
    - um: "University of Maryland"
    - unm: "University of New Mexico"
    - wat: "University of Waterloo"
    - uc: "University of California / Chicago"
    
  geographic:
    local: [atl, ba, ca, chi, cmh, dfw, ga, la, ne, nj, ny, oh, or, pa, pnw, tx]
    regional: [na, usa, can, ont, uk, eunet]
    global: [net, world]
    
  cultural_note: |
    "net" meant "the entire USENET" — not the internet.
    "world" was the broadest distribution.
    The distinction mattered when bandwidth was precious.

# %feeds — UUCP Feed Configuration  
feeds:
  what: |
    Actual UUCP feed configuration for ESR's site.
    Shows who received what newsgroups from whom.
    
  sites:
    snark:
      role: "Primary site (ESR's machine?)"
      feeds: "comp,news,sci,misc,soc,rec,talk,alt,gnu"
      distributions: "world,pa,usa,na,to.snark"
      
    cbmvax:
      role: "Commodore Business Machines VAX"
      level: "L1 (leaf node)"
      note: "Commodore was still relevant in 1988"
      
    vu-vlsi:
      role: "Villanova VLSI lab?"
      level: "L1 (leaf node)"
      
  archaeology: |
    These were real machines, connected by phone lines.
    News propagated hop by hop, taking hours or days.
    "L1" means leaf node — receives but doesn't forward.

# %mailpaths — Moderated Group Submission Addresses
mailpaths:
  what: |
    Email addresses for submitting to moderated newsgroups.
    Shows the email/news hybrid system.
    
  notable_addresses:
    comp.risks: "risks@csl.sri.com"
    comp.sources.unix: "sources@uunet.uu.net"
    gnu.announce: "info-gnu@prep.mit.ai.edu"
    rec.humor.funny: "Not listed — Brad Templeton moderated"
    
  address_formats:
    arpa: "user@host.arpa — ARPANET addresses"
    uucp: "user@host.uucp — UUCP bang paths"
    edu: "user@host.edu — emerging DNS"
    
  institutions:
    sri: "SRI International (comp.risks)"
    mit: "MIT (GNU project)"
    berkeley: "UC Berkeley (BSD)"
    purdue: "Purdue (Amiga sources)"
    att: "AT&T (C standards, newprod)"
    
  cultural_note: |
    Moderated groups had human editors.
    You emailed your submission; they posted it.
    Quality control before Reddit, before social media.

  cultural_snapshot: |
    This was the internet before the web.
    No images. No HTML. Just text.
    Every group was hand-created by committee.
    Every moderator was a volunteer.
    
    The people in these groups would later:
    - Create the web (comp.infosystems)
    - Build Linux (comp.os.minix alumni)
    - Write the cathedral and bazaar (comp.* regulars)
    - Shape internet culture for decades

# Archaeological Significance
significance:
  for_tmnn: |
    TMNN was a news READER for this ecosystem.
    These files configured which groups it could access.
    ESR was embedded in this culture when he wrote TMNN.
    
  for_esr_critique: |
    ESR was ON comp.risks.
    He read about buffer overflows.
    He shipped gets() anyway.
    
    This is not ignorance. This is negligence.
    
  for_internet_history: |
    Pre-web internet preserved in configuration files.
    361 newsgroups = 361 communities.
    Geographic distributions = physical topology.
    UUCP feeds = actual phone connections.
    
    The internet was smaller, slower, and more intentional.
    Every bit cost money. Every group was curated.
