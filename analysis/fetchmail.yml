# Fetchmail: ESR's Other Security-Challenged Project
# The project featured in "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" also had problems

the_project:
  name: fetchmail
  what_it_does: "Email retrieval utility (POP3/IMAP to local delivery)"
  created_by: "Eric S. Raymond"
  year: 1996
  license: "GPL"
  
  significance: |
    Fetchmail is the primary case study in ESR's famous essay 
    "The Cathedral and the Bazaar." ESR used his experience developing 
    fetchmail to formulate his theories about open source development.

  essay: "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"

    - "Open development worked better than closed"
    - "Release early, release often was validated"

    quote: |
      fetchmail 6.2.x was handed over in a pretty poor shape, security-wise
    issues_found:
      - "Running with root privileges"
      - "Using unsafe functions like sscanf() without length limitations"
      - "Requiring a full security audit"
    note: "This assessment was from later maintainers describing the state ESR left it in"

the_irony:
  catb_claims_vs_reality:
    claim: "Many eyeballs make all bugs are shallow"
    reality: |
      Fetchmail had numerous security vulnerabilities discovered years 
      after ESR's development. The "many eyeballs" didn't catch:
      - Root privilege issues
      - Unsafe function usage
      - SSL/TLS validation problems
      
    later_maintainer_assessment: |
      "Handed over in a pretty poor shape, security-wise" - this is what 
      the "many eyes" model produced under ESR's stewardship.

tmnn_parallel:
  both_projects_show:
    - "Unsafe function usage"
    - "Security as an afterthought"
    - "Code quality issues requiring later cleanup"
    
  pattern: |
    ESR's coding style is consistent across projects:
    - TMNN (1989): 774 buffer overflow risks, 42 race conditions, 61 command injections
    - fetchmail (1996+): "Handed over in pretty poor shape, security-wise"
    
    The man who wrote about how open source development produces 
    better code produced code that needed security audits.

  note: |
    Fetchmail continues to be maintained by others who have 
    addressed many of the security issues ESR left behind.

bigger_picture: |
  ESR built his reputation on fetchmail, using it as the centerpiece 
  of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar." But fetchmail's actual security 
  history undermines the essay's claims:
  
  1. "Many eyeballs" didn't catch the problems
  2. The code was "pretty poor shape, security-wise" when handed over
  3. Security vulnerabilities continued to be discovered for decades
  
  Just like TMNN, fetchmail shows ESR could articulate principles 
  but couldn't follow them in his own code.
