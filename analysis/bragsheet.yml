# BRAGSHEET Analysis - ESR's Promises vs Reality
# YAML Jazz: Comments carry semantic weight
# The man who would later preach humility wrote this monument to himself

# The opening salvo - note the grandiosity
announcement:
  tone: "messianic"  # "Hear ye, hear ye" energy from a guy in his basement
  self_description: "software construct known as TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA NETNEWS"
  # "Software construct" - because "program" wasn't pretentious enough
  origin_myth: "escaped from the secret laboratories of Thyrsus Enterprises"
  # Thyrsus = ESR's consulting company. Named after the staff of Dionysus.
  # Even his company name is pretentious mythological cosplay.
  # "Secret laboratories" = his apartment in Malvern, PA

  claimed_development_time: "two years"
  # Two years alone. The "release early, release often" guy. Sure.
  promised_identity: "News 3.0"
  actual_version_released: "B3.0 (beta level 7.8)"
  # Never made it past beta. "News 3.0" was vaporware.
  # The "B" stands for "beta" but might as well stand for "buried"

marketing_claims:
  # Direct quotes from BRAGSHEET - each one aged like milk

  complete_rewrite:
    claim: "complete from-the-ground-up rewrite of the entire suite"
    reality: "Built on B News foundation, copied Spafford's code"
    # "From the ground up" - standing on the shoulders of giants while claiming to be tall

  code_quality:
    claim: "carefully modularized in accordance with abstract-data-type design principles"
    reality: "774 buffer overflows, global state everywhere"
    # "Abstract-data-type design principles" - buzzwords from someone who uses gets()

  documentation:
    claim: "lavishly commented for comprehensibility"
    reality: "Comments include 'This routine is a HOG!!!!!' and 'ugly and flaky'"
    # Five exclamation points is not "lavish" - it's unhinged

  accompanying_docs:
    claim: "full set of documents detailing installation, usage and the architecture internals"
    reality: "BUGS file lists incomplete features, 'TO DO' items never done"
    # The TODO list became a tombstone

promised_features:
  # Features promised in "the future" section
  # Spoiler: the future never came

  hypertext:
    status: never_delivered
    quote: "a design for a distributed hypertext service netnews option"
    claimed_advisors: ["Robin Hansen", "Mark Miller"]
    # Name-dropping "leading figures in the hypertext research community"
    # Translation: "I talked to some people at a conference once"

  encryption:
    status: never_delivered
    quote: "a public-key encryption system for authentication purposes"
    begging: "Anyone who has working C source for such a thing is requested to E-mail me"
    # He didn't even have the code - was asking others to provide it
    # "Please do my work for me so I can take credit"

  intelligent_agents:
    status: never_delivered
    quote: "intelligent filtering agents (perhaps starting with keyword-based retrieval)"
    # "perhaps" - hedging even in the brag document
    # "Intelligent agents" in 1989 = if/else statements

  advanced_services:
    status: never_delivered
    quote: "experiments in advanced logical-network services"
    vagueness_level: maximum
    # Word salad that means nothing. Peak consultantspeak.

cathedral_evidence:
  # Evidence of "cathedral" development style from the guy who later wrote "The Bazaar"
  # The hypocrisy is load-bearing

  secrecy:
    quote: "secret laboratories"
    duration: "two years"
    collaboration: none_mentioned
    # "Secret" is not a synonym for "open source"

  perfectionism:
    - "after two years of development"
    - Named advisors but no co-developers
    - No bazaar, no community, no "release early, release often"
    # He was building a cathedral while the bazaar existed. Then wrote about bazaars.

  irony_score: 10  # Out of 10. The scale doesn't go higher.

call_to_action:
  recruitment_pitch: |
    You too can be a part of this epic. By using the standard 3.0 service
    libraries, you can easily keep protocol and functional compatibility
  credits_promise: "The credits list may be waiting for your name!"
  # No one's name was ever added. The project died before anyone could join.
  # The credits list is still waiting. It will wait forever.
