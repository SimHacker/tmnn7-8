    key_quote: |
      I'm the crippled kid who became a black-belt martial artist and teacher
      of martial artists. I've made the New York Times bestseller list as a
      writer. You can hardly use a browser, a cellphone, or a game console
      without relying on my code. I've been a session musician on two records.
      I've blown up the software industry once, reinvented the hacker culture
      twice, and am without doubt one of the dozen most famous geeks alive.
      Investment bankers pay me $300 an hour to yak at them because I have a
      track record as a shrewd business analyst. I don't even have a BS, yet
      there's been an entire academic cottage industry devoted to writing
      exegeses of my work. I could do nothing but speaking tours for the rest
      of my life and still be overbooked. Earnest people have struggled their
      whole lives to change the world less than I routinely do when I'm not
      even really trying.
    # The post is titled "Ego is for little people." Unironically.

      My wife Cathy asked me a simple question last night, and I realized I
      didn't have an answer to it. "Are you" she asked "the most famous
      programmer in the world?"
    # He then spends the post seriously analyzing the question

  new_hackers_dictionary:
    resume_text: |
      I conceived and edited The New Hacker's Dictionary (MIT Press, 1991).
      This book received enthusiastic reviews in The New York Times, PC Magazine,
      Byte, PC World, UNIX Review, IEEE Spectrum...
    reality: "Appropriated MIT-AI Lab community document"

  gnu_emacs:
    resume_text: |
      I have been an active member of the GNU project, and was principally
      responsible for EMACS Lisp maintenance between December 1991 and June 1993.

      This book reached #7 on the New York Times's list of business-book bestsellers.
    contrast: "tptacek: 'CATB has just not held up at all; it's actively bad'"

  netscape_claim:
    resume_text: |
      This paper was subsequently described by Netscape Communications, Inc.,
      as a major factor in their decision to release their client software as
      open source.
    brendan_eich_clarification: |
      CatB was waved around (not sure that the most ardent wavers actually
      read it) inside Netscape in late 1997 as a gesture to support the
      argument

pattern_analysis:
  successful_projects: "prominently featured with extensive detail"
  failed_projects: "buried in generic language"

  tmnn_handling:
    strategy: "minimize and genericize"
    result: "unrecognizable unless you know to look"

  consistent_with:
    - Never discussing TMNN in interviews
    - Not linking to archived code
    - Not mentioning it in CATB despite relevance
