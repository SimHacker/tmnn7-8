      I conceived and edited The New Hacker's Dictionary (MIT Press, 1991).
      This book received enthusiastic reviews in The New York Times, PC Magazine,
      Byte, PC World, UNIX Review, IEEE Spectrum...
    reality: "Appropriated MIT-AI Lab community document"

  gnu_emacs:
    resume_text: |
      I have been an active member of the GNU project, and was principally
      responsible for EMACS Lisp maintenance between December 1991 and June 1993.

    resume_text: |
      This paper was subsequently described by Netscape Communications, Inc.,
      as a major factor in their decision to release their client software as
      open source.
    brendan_eich_clarification: |
      CatB was waved around (not sure that the most ardent wavers actually
      read it) inside Netscape in late 1997 as a gesture to support the
      argument

pattern_analysis:
  successful_projects: "prominently featured with extensive detail"
  failed_projects: "buried in generic language"

  tmnn_handling:
    strategy: "minimize and genericize"
    result: "unrecognizable unless you know to look"

  consistent_with:
    - Never discussing TMNN in interviews
    - Not linking to archived code
    - Not mentioning it in CATB despite relevance
