      His infamous "Sex Tips for Geeks" essay comes off like it was 
      written by Pepé Le Pew.
    note: "Pepé Le Pew is the Warner Bros character known for aggressively pursuing women who are clearly not interested"
    # This comparison is unfair to Pepé Le Pew

the_honeytrap_conspiracy:
  # ESR's 2015 claim that feminist activists were framing male developers
  # The plot twist nobody saw coming (because it didn't happen)

  the_claim: |
    Feminist activists (specifically the Ada Initiative) were orchestrating 
    "honeytraps" at tech conferences to fabricate sexual assault accusations 
    against prominent male open-source developers.
  # Citation: "trust me bro" and an anonymous IRC source
    
  alleged_method:
    quote: |
      get alone with the target, and then immediately after cry 
      'attempted sexual assault.'
    # This is what ESR thinks women do at tech conferences
      
  named_target:
    person: "Linus Torvalds"
    claim: |
      Linus is never alone at any conference... They have made multiple 
      runs at him.
    # "Multiple runs at Linus" - accusations: zero
      
  evidence_provided: "Anonymous IRC source"
  # An anonymous person on IRC said it. Case closed.
  accusations_that_materialized: 0
  # Zero. The number is zero.
  
  his_warning_to_men:
    quote: |
      if you are any kind of open-source leader or senior figure who is male, 
      do not be alone with any female, ever, at a technical conference.
    # From "women will fall all over themselves" to "never be alone with any female"
    # Character development?

the_ada_initiative:
  what_it_was: "Women-in-tech advocacy organization"
  closed: 2015
  actual_work: "Promoted codes of conduct and anti-harassment policies"
  # You know, anti-harassment. The thing ESR opposes.
  response_to_esr: "None public"
  torvalds_response: "None public"
  # Linus didn't even dignify it with a response
  
  actual_outcome: |
    The Ada Initiative closed in 2015. No accusations against Linus Torvalds 
    or other open-source leaders materialized. ESR's conspiracy theory 
    remains unsubstantiated.
  # The honeytraps: notably absent

the_pattern:
  sex_tips: |
    ESR positions himself as an expert on attracting women, writing a 
    series of essays with advice based on "evolutionary psychology."
  # Self-appointed dating guru
    
  honeytrap: |
    Years later, ESR warns men to never be alone with women at conferences 
    because women are supposedly trying to frame them.
  # Self-appointed women-are-dangerous warner
    
  contradiction: |
    The man who wrote "Trust me, if you do these things women will fall 
    all over themselves trying to get at you" later warned men that women 
    at tech conferences are dangerous predators.
  # Which is it, Eric?

connection_to_tmnn:
  fascist_c: |
    In fascist.c, ESR embedded his political worldview directly into code 
    (FASCIST/COMMUNIST flags). The "sex tips" and "honeytrap" writings show 
    the same tendency: inject personal ideology into technical spaces.
  # He can't write code without writing manifestos
    
  pattern: |
    ESR consistently uses technical platforms and communities to promote 
    his personal views on politics, gender, and social organization.
  # Every space is a soapbox
