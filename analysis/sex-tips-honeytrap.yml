the_honeytrap_conspiracy:
  # ESR's 2015 claim that feminist activists were framing male developers
  
  date: 2015-11
  blog_post: "From kafkatrap to honeytrap"
  source: http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=6907
  
  the_claim: |
    Feminist activists (specifically the Ada Initiative) were orchestrating 
    "honeytraps" at tech conferences to fabricate sexual assault accusations 
    against prominent male open-source developers.
    
  alleged_method:
    quote: |
      get alone with the target, and then immediately after cry 
      'attempted sexual assault.'
      
  named_target:
    person: "Linus Torvalds"
    claim: |
      Linus is never alone at any conference... They have made multiple 
      runs at him.
      
  evidence_provided: "Anonymous IRC source"
  accusations_that_materialized: 0
  
  his_warning_to_men:
    quote: |
      if you are any kind of open-source leader or senior figure who is male, 
      do not be alone with any female, ever, at a technical conference.

the_ada_initiative:
  what_it_was: "Women-in-tech advocacy organization"
  closed: 2015
  actual_work: "Promoted codes of conduct and anti-harassment policies"
  response_to_esr: "None public"
  torvalds_response: "None public"
  
  actual_outcome: |
    The Ada Initiative closed in 2015. No accusations against Linus Torvalds 
    or other open-source leaders materialized. ESR's conspiracy theory 
    remains unsubstantiated.

the_pattern:
  sex_tips: |
    ESR positions himself as an expert on attracting women, writing a 
    series of essays with advice based on "evolutionary psychology."
    
  honeytrap: |
    Years later, ESR warns men to never be alone with women at conferences 
    because women are supposedly trying to frame them.
    
  contradiction: |
    The man who wrote "Trust me, if you do these things women will fall 
    all over themselves trying to get at you" later warned men that women 
    at tech conferences are dangerous predators.

connection_to_tmnn:
  fascist_c: |
    In fascist.c, ESR embedded his political worldview directly into code 
    (FASCIST/COMMUNIST flags). The "sex tips" and "honeytrap" writings show 
    the same tendency: inject personal ideology into technical spaces.
    
  pattern: |
    ESR consistently uses technical platforms and communities to promote 
    his personal views on politics, gender, and social organization.
