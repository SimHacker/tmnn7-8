donhopkins_testimony:
  source: Hacker News
  relationship: "Known ESR since early 1980s"
  key_quote: |
    His own failed proprietary closed source 'cathedral' project, that he was 
    notorious for insufferably and arrogantly bragging about during the 80's, 
    but never releasing, and finally giving up on because he didn't have the 
    skills to finish and deliver it, and nobody wanted to collaborate with him 
    or listen to him talk about it any more.
