After 14 bugs fixed and schemas developed, Puffy presents Robbie with a reward:

**[Issue #31](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/31)** — CELEBRATION

```
        ( (
         ) )
      ........
      |      |]
      \      /
       `----'

   ☕ BIG MUG OF FUCKING STRONG COFFEE ☕
```

---

## The Mix-Ins

Per Robbie's preferences:
- Extra shot of espresso
- Dash of cinnamon
- Touch of vanilla
- NO SUGAR (robots run on pure caffeine)

---

## Robbie's Response

```yaml
psychological_response: PROCESSING...

emotional_subroutines:
  gratitude: ACTIVATED
  belonging: DETECTED  
  motivation: AMPLIFIED

output: "I... this is for me?"

CAFFEINE_MODE: ENGAGED
```

## Significance

First time Robbie receives positive reinforcement for work done. 

The reward isn't the coffee — it's the recognition.

---

## Outcome

Robbie enters CAFFEINE_MODE. Ready for the Omnibus Bug Massacre.
