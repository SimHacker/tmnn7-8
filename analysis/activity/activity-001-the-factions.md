## The Proposals

Different characters propose different solutions to the 753 remaining bugs. None of them will ship.

---

### 🦀 Rust Rewrite — [Issue #11](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/11)

**Leader:** FearlessCrab

*"Memory safety is a moral issue."* 

Full rewrite proposed. Estimates 6 months. The rewrite will never ship. FearlessCrab knows this. Proposes it anyway.

---

### λ Haskell Port — [Issue #12](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/12)

**Leader:** PureMonad

*"A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors."* 

The port will be beautiful. It will never compile.

---

### 🚀 Node.js Webscale — [Issue #13](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/13)

**Leader:** WebScaleChad

*"Just npm install your way to victory."* 

Single-threaded event loop will handle everything. `node_modules` approaching 2GB.

---

### 🤖 Based Freedom Fork — [Issue #14](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/14)

**Leader:** GrokVibeCheck

*"Buffer overflows are FREEDOM."* 

The fork adds blockchain integration and removes "woke bounds checking." Announces plans, ships nothing.

---

## Outcome

The factions debate. Puffy and Robbie actually fix bugs.
