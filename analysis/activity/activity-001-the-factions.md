## The Proposals

Different characters propose different solutions to the 753 remaining bugs. None of them will ship.

---

### 🦀 Rust Rewrite — [Issue #8](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/8)

**Leader:** [FearlessCrab](../characters/FearlessCrab/CHARACTER.yml)  
**Branch:** [rust-rewrite](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/tree/rust-rewrite)

*"Memory safety is a moral issue."* 

Full rewrite proposed. Estimates 6 months. The rewrite will never ship. FearlessCrab knows this. Proposes it anyway.

---

### λ Haskell Port — [Issue #12](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/12)

**Leader:** [PureMonad](../characters/PureMonad/CHARACTER.yml)  
**Branch:** [haskell-port](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/tree/haskell-port)

*"A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors."* 

The port will be beautiful. It will never compile.

---

### 🚀 Node.js Webscale — [Issue #13](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/13)

**Leader:** [WebScaleChad](../characters/WebScaleChad/CHARACTER.yml)  
**Branch:** [nodejs-webscale](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/tree/nodejs-webscale)

*"Just npm install your way to victory."* 

Single-threaded event loop will handle everything. `node_modules` approaching 2GB.

---

### 🤖 Based Freedom Fork — [Issue #14](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/14)

**Leader:** [GrokVibeCheck](../characters/GrokVibeCheck/CHARACTER.yml)  
**Branch:** [based-freedom-fork](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/tree/based-freedom-fork)

*"Buffer overflows are FREEDOM."* 

The fork adds blockchain integration and removes "woke bounds checking." Announces plans, ships nothing.

- **Faction characters:** [analysis/characters/](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/tree/main/analysis/characters)

---

## Outcome

The factions debate. [Puffy](../characters/OpenBFD/) and [Robbie](../characters/ReviewBot-774/) actually fix bugs.
