        Real hackers from the MIT-AI lab where it originated consider his 
        revisionist politically slanted rewriting-for-profit of the Hacker's 
        Dictionary to be disrespectful parasitical vandalism that doesn't 
        represent the actual hacker culture, just a tool he hijacked, corrupted, 
        and abused to spread his right-wing political ideology.
      # "Disrespectful parasitical vandalism" - accurate
      - |
        He certainly doesn't deserve to be called a hacker, let alone presume 
        to define the meaning of the term.
      # The guy who rewrote the hacker dictionary isn't a hacker
    credentials: "Known ESR since early 1980s, was present at MIT AI Lab"
    # First-hand witness

  description: "The original MIT ITS jargon file, free of ESR's pollution"
  # "Free of ESR's pollution" - liberation theology
  note: "This is what it looked like before ESR rewrote it"

what_esr_changed:
  additions:
    - "Political content reflecting ESR's libertarian views"
    - "Self-referential entries promoting ESR's own work"
    # "See also: my essays, my books, my genius"
    - "Redefinitions that changed the meaning of hacker culture"
  removals_or_diminishments:
    - "Original MIT/Stanford cultural context"
    - "Contributions from people ESR disagreed with"
    # If you're not on Team ESR, you get edited out
  net_effect: |
    Transformed a collaborative community document into a vehicle for 
    ESR's personal ideology and self-promotion
  # Turned "our history" into "my resume"

the_pattern: |
  ESR has a recurring pattern of:
  1. Finding something created by others
  2. Taking it over during a period of inactivity
  3. Rewriting it to reflect his views
  4. Publishing it as if it represents the original community
  5. Profiting from and claiming credit for others' work
  
  The Jargon File is the clearest example, but see also:
  - His claims about defining "hacker" culture
  - "How to Become a Hacker" essay
  - "Linus's Law" (attributed to someone who never said it)
  
  # It's not a pattern, it's a business model

parallel_to_tmnn:
  note: |
    In TMNN, ESR took Eugene Spafford's fascist.c code and "rewrote" it,
    adding his political ideology (FASCIST/COMMUNIST flags) and buffer 
    overflows. The pattern is consistent: take others' work, insert 
    politics, break things, claim credit.
  # Spafford: security legend
  # ESR: added security vulnerabilities
  # The audacity
