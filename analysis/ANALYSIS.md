## The Irony

ESR later became famous for:

1. **"The Cathedral and the Bazaar" (1997)** — Advocating "release early, release often"
   - TMNN: 2 years in "secret laboratories" before any release

2. **"Linus's Law"** — "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"
   - TMNN: No community review, 774+ vulnerabilities remained

3. **"The Art of Unix Programming" (2003)** — Unix best practices
   - TMNN: Violates most of those practices

4. **Co-founding Open Source Initiative** — Promoting open development
   - TMNN: Proprietary cathedral development, never shared
