# YAML Jazz: The license tells us more about ESR than about the software

meta:
  filename: LICENSE
  title: "NETNEWS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"
  date: 1988
  # Pre-dates his "open source" advocacy by a decade

political_preamble:
  # The license opens with ESR's political philosophy, not legal terms
  
  property_rights_absolutism:
    quote: |
      I support strict intellectual property laws and the right of designers
      to own, control, and dispose of their creative work in whatever ways and
      under whatever terms the free market will allow.
    position: "libertarian property maximalism"
    
  anti_commons:
    quote: |
      I oppose any and all attempts to alienate designers from their work by 
      denying them property rights therein, including denial of the right to 
      hold software proprietary.
    # This is the "open source" guy arguing FOR proprietary rights
    
  fsf_distancing:
    quote: |
      My action is not to be construed as an endorsement of the political or
      economic views or personal crusades of any member, agent, or ally of the
      Free Software Foundation other than myself.
    target: RMS and FSF
    # Explicitly attacks FSF while using GPL-like terms
    tone: "passive aggressive"
    
  voluntary_sharing_emphasis:
    quote: "I support *voluntary* sharing"
    # Emphasis his - he added asterisks
    subtext: "Free Software Foundation's approach is coerced sharing"

ideology_in_license:
  # ESR embeds his entire worldview
  
  free_market_evangelism:
    quote: |
      Believing as I do that this goal may be best accomplished within a society 
      of private enterprise and free markets, I not only permit but encourage 
      commercial and for-profit use of this software.
      
  libertarian_creed:
    quote: |
      please guide your use of the news software by respect for personal, 
      political, and economic freedom; by support for natural property and 
      contract rights; and by affirming the autonomy and privacy of individuals 
      and voluntary associations.
    # A software license that asks users to adopt libertarian politics
    
  censorship_absolutism:
    quote: |
      And, most especially, please join me in opposing unconditionally every 
      form of and rationalization for censorship. The marketplace of ideas is, 
      ultimately, the most important free market of all.
    irony: "From the man who wrote fascist.c to control who could post"

    nuisance message on startup has been deleted
