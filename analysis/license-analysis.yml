# LICENSE Analysis - ESR's Political Manifesto in Legal Clothing
# YAML Jazz: The license tells us more about ESR than about the software
# 40% political screed, 60% GPL ripoff, 100% ESR

meta:
  filename: LICENSE
  title: "NETNEWS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"
  date: 1988
  # Pre-dates his "open source" advocacy by a decade
  # And contradicts everything he'd later claim to believe

political_preamble:
  # The license opens with ESR's political philosophy, not legal terms
  # Because what software license doesn't need a libertarian manifesto?
  
  property_rights_absolutism:
    quote: |
      I support strict intellectual property laws and the right of designers
      to own, control, and dispose of their creative work in whatever ways and
      under whatever terms the free market will allow.
    position: "libertarian property maximalism"
    # The future "open source" guy arguing for strict IP laws
    # Make it make sense
    
  anti_commons:
    quote: |
      I oppose any and all attempts to alienate designers from their work by 
      denying them property rights therein, including denial of the right to 
      hold software proprietary.
    # This is the "open source" guy arguing FOR proprietary rights
    # The cognitive dissonance could power a small city
    
  fsf_distancing:
    quote: |
      My action is not to be construed as an endorsement of the political or
      economic views or personal crusades of any member, agent, or ally of the
      Free Software Foundation other than myself.
    target: RMS and FSF
    # Explicitly attacks FSF while using GPL-like terms
    # "I'll take your license but not your cooties"
    tone: "passive aggressive"
    # Peak passive aggressive - in a software license
    
  voluntary_sharing_emphasis:
    quote: "I support *voluntary* sharing"
    # Emphasis his - he added asterisks
    # In 1988. In a license file.
    subtext: "Free Software Foundation's approach is coerced sharing"
    # Sir, this is a Wendy's. I mean, a license file.

ideology_in_license:
  # ESR embeds his entire worldview
  # A software license that requires you to agree with libertarianism
  
  free_market_evangelism:
    quote: |
      Believing as I do that this goal may be best accomplished within a society 
      of private enterprise and free markets, I not only permit but encourage 
      commercial and for-profit use of this software.
    # "I permit commercial use" - as if anyone was waiting for permission
      
  libertarian_creed:
    quote: |
      please guide your use of the news software by respect for personal, 
      political, and economic freedom; by support for natural property and 
      contract rights; and by affirming the autonomy and privacy of individuals 
      and voluntary associations.
    # A software license that asks users to adopt libertarian politics
    # "Accept the LICENSE terms: [x] I agree to become a libertarian"
    
  censorship_absolutism:
    quote: |
      And, most especially, please join me in opposing unconditionally every 
      form of and rationalization for censorship. The marketplace of ideas is, 
      ultimately, the most important free market of all.
    irony: "From the man who wrote fascist.c to control who could post"
    # "Oppose all censorship" says man who wrote censorship tools
    # Peak irony achieved

commercial_plug:
  # Yes, an actual advertisement in a software license
  # Stay classy, Eric
  
  section_title: "AN UNABASHED COMMERCIAL PLUG"
  # He literally named it this. Unironically.
  
  content:
    offer: "I am available at competitive rates as a consultant"
    services: "customized netnews versions as an information-sharing tool"
    # For software that was abandoned at beta 7.8

      # The "secret laboratories" had a street address
    solicitation: "don't hesitate to call"
    # "Please hire me" - in a license file
    
  professionalism: "embedding sales pitch in FOSS license"
  # No other open source license has a "COMMERCIAL PLUG" section
  # Because that would be tacky

nuisance_message_deletion:
  # He modified GPL specifically to remove startup message requirement
  
  quote: |
    only the portion that would have required the software to display a 
    nuisance message on startup has been deleted
  translation: "I find FSF's attribution requirements annoying"
  # His words: "nuisance message"
  # Today we call this "credit" or "attribution"
  # ESR calls it a "nuisance"

legal_actual:
  # The actual legal terms are mostly GPL-derived
  # With extra ESR sprinkled on top
  base: "GNU Emacs General Public License"
  modifications:
    - Removed startup message requirement
    - Added political preamble
    - Added commercial advertisement
    - Added libertarian philosophy requirements
  # It's GPL with a side of Ayn Rand
