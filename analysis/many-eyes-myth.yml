# "Many Eyes" / "Linus's Law": The Myth ESR Invented
# Analysis of ESR's most famous (and problematic) claim
# YAML Jazz: Named after a man who never said it

the_claim:
  statement: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
  named: "Linus's Law"
  # Named after someone who never said it. Bold move.
  source: "The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1997)"
  attribution: "Named after Linus Torvalds"
  # Torvalds: famously never said this

the_problem:
  linus_never_said_it: true
  torvalds_quote: null  # Linus has never claimed or endorsed this "law"
  # Imagine naming your made-up quote after someone who didn't say it
  # to avoid responsibility when it turns out to be wrong

      He made up the ridiculous 'many eyes' quote himself, then misnamed it
      'Linus's Law' to avoid personal responsibility and shift the blame to
      innocent Linus Torvalds, who never said such a stupid thing.

    Oh right, let's hear some of that 'many eyes' crap again. My favorite
    part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were found by the two
    eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement). All the many eyes are
    apparently attached to a lot of hands that type lots of words about
    many eyes, and never actually audit code.
  # "Type lots of words about many eyes, and never actually audit code"
  # Theo just ended this man's whole career in one paragraph
  significance: |
    The founder of the most security-focused operating system explicitly
    mocking ESR's "many eyes" claim, noting that ESR himself never audited code.

empirical_evidence_against:
  # Reality: a harsh mistress to ESR's theories

  heartbleed:
    year: 2014
    what: "Critical OpenSSL vulnerability"
    eyes_that_saw_it: "None for 2+ years"
    note: "Millions of servers, thousands of developers, zero detection"
    # Many eyes. Very shallow. Much security. Wow.

  shellshock:
    year: 2014
    what: "Bash shell vulnerability"
    age: "25 years undetected"
    note: "One of the most reviewed pieces of software in existence"
    # 25 years. TWENTY-FIVE. Where were the eyeballs?

  tmnn_itself:
    year: 1989
    what: "ESR's own code"
    vulnerabilities_undetected:
      buffer_overflows: 774
      race_conditions: 42
      command_injections: 61
    note: "The guy who coined 'many eyes' had zero eyes on his own code"
    # 774 buffer overflows. Zero eyeballs. Not shallow at all.

academic_criticism:
  paper: "A second look at the Cathedral and the Bazaar"
  author: "Nikolai Bezroukov"
  journal: "First Monday"
  url: https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/download/708/618/
  finding: "The bazaar metaphor is internally contradictory"
  # Even academics could see through it

why_esr_named_it_after_linus:
  theory: "Responsibility deflection"
  # Not just a theory - it's the obvious explanation
  explanation: |
    By attributing his dubious claim to Linus Torvalds, ESR:
    1. Borrowed credibility from someone respected
    2. Avoided personal accountability when the claim proved false
    3. Made it awkward to criticize (attacking "Linus's Law" sounds anti-Linus)
  problem: "Linus never made this claim or endorsed it"
  # It's intellectual money laundering

the_irony: |
  The man who invented "many eyes make all bugs shallow" never had many eyes
  on his own code. His TMNN project was developed in isolation for two years,
  released briefly, then abandoned. No eyes ever audited it.

  Meanwhile, massive projects with millions of eyes still had critical bugs
  hiding for decades. The claim was never empirically validated; it was just
  a catchy phrase ESR made up.

  Real security researchers like Theo de Raadt have always known this was
  nonsense. The "many eyes" aren't auditing code - they're "typing lots of
  words about many eyes."

  # The many eyes were the friends we didn't make along the way

community_code_review:
  # ESR believes in code review. Now he gets some.
  purpose: "Apply ESR's own principle to ESR's own code"
  inspiration:
    event: "ESR's 2009 Climategate code audit"
    url: https://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=1447
    what_happened: |
      ESR audited climate scientists' code, claimed to find fraud.
      His analysis highlighted COMMENTED-OUT code as evidence.
      The scientists were later fully vindicated.
      ESR's "audit" was incompetent and politically motivated.
