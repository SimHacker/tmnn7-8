# "Many Eyes" / "Linus's Law": The Myth ESR Invented
# Analysis of ESR's most famous (and problematic) claim

the_claim:
  statement: "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
  named: "Linus's Law"
  source: "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" (1997)
  attribution: "Named after Linus Torvalds"
  
the_problem:
  linus_never_said_it: true
  torvalds_quote: null  # Linus has never claimed or endorsed this "law"

      He made up the ridiculous 'many eyes' quote himself, then misnamed it 
      'Linus's Law' to avoid personal responsibility and shift the blame to 
      innocent Linus Torvalds, who never said such a stupid thing.

    Oh right, let's hear some of that 'many eyes' crap again. My favorite 
    part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were found by the two 
    eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement). All the many eyes are 
    apparently attached to a lot of hands that type lots of words about 
    many eyes, and never actually audit code.
  significance: |
    The founder of the most security-focused operating system explicitly 
    mocking ESR's "many eyes" claim, noting that ESR himself never audited code.

empirical_evidence_against:
  heartbleed:
    year: 2014
    what: "Critical OpenSSL vulnerability"
    eyes_that_saw_it: "None for 2+ years"
    note: "Millions of servers, thousands of developers, zero detection"
    
  shellshock:
    year: 2014
    what: "Bash shell vulnerability"
    age: "25 years undetected"
    note: "One of the most reviewed pieces of software in existence"
    
  tmnn_itself:
    year: 1989
    what: "ESR's own code"
    vulnerabilities_undetected:
      buffer_overflows: 774
      race_conditions: 42
      command_injections: 61
    note: "The guy who coined 'many eyes' had zero eyes on his own code"

  author: "Nikolai Bezroukov"

  finding: "The bazaar metaphor is internally contradictory"

why_esr_named_it_after_linus:
  theory: "Responsibility deflection"
  explanation: |
    By attributing his dubious claim to Linus Torvalds, ESR:
    1. Borrowed credibility from someone respected
    2. Avoided personal accountability when the claim proved false
    3. Made it awkward to criticize (attacking "Linus's Law" sounds anti-Linus)
  problem: "Linus never made this claim or endorsed it"

the_irony: |
  The man who invented "many eyes make all bugs shallow" never had many eyes 
  on his own code. His TMNN project was developed in isolation for two years, 
  released briefly, then abandoned. No eyes ever audited it.
  
  Meanwhile, massive projects with millions of eyes still had critical bugs 
  hiding for decades. The claim was never empirically validated; it was just 
  a catchy phrase ESR made up.
  
  Real security researchers like Theo de Raadt have always known this was 
  nonsense. The "many eyes" aren't auditing code - they're "typing lots of 
  words about many eyes."
