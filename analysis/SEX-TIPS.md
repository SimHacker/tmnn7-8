# Sex Tips for Geeks & The Honeytrap Conspiracy

From pickup artist to panic merchant.

## Sex Tips for Geeks

Yes, this exists. No, we're not making it up.

ESR wrote a series of essays advising male geeks on attracting women — a trilogy nobody asked for:

- "How To Be Sexy"
- "The Art of the Pickup"
- "On Being Good In Bed"

Sample advice:

> "Emit fitness-to-reproduce signals... your bulging, tumescent hacker forebrain is just not going to turn on very many women by itself."

"Bulging, tumescent hacker forebrain" — actual quote. We cannot stress enough: he wrote this unironically.

His promise to readers:

> "Trust me, if you do these things women will fall all over themselves trying to get at you."

"Trust me" — always a good sign. Narrator: they did not fall all over themselves.

The claimed basis? "Evolutionary psychology" — the astrology of people who think they're too smart for astrology.

DonHopkins' assessment:

> "His infamous 'Sex Tips for Geeks' essay comes off like it was written by Pepé Le Pew."

Pepé Le Pew is the Warner Bros character known for aggressively pursuing women who are clearly not interested. This comparison is unfair to Pepé Le Pew.

## The Honeytrap Conspiracy

In November 2015, ESR published a blog post claiming feminist activists — specifically the Ada Initiative — were orchestrating "honeytraps" at tech conferences to fabricate sexual assault accusations against prominent male open-source developers.

The plot twist nobody saw coming (because it didn't happen).

The alleged method:

> "Get alone with the target, and then immediately after cry 'attempted sexual assault.'"

This is what ESR thinks women do at tech conferences.

He named a specific target:

> "Linus is never alone at any conference... They have made multiple runs at him."

"Multiple runs at Linus" — accusations that actually materialized: zero.

His evidence? An anonymous IRC source. An anonymous person on IRC said it. Case closed.

His warning to men:

> "If you are any kind of open-source leader or senior figure who is male, do not be alone with any female, ever, at a technical conference."

From "women will fall all over themselves" to "never be alone with any female." Character development?

## Media Coverage

The Register noted "ESR's credibility was questionable given previous controversial claims." Even The Register was like "uh, about that."

Meanwhile, Breitbart ran with: "Feminists Are Trying To Frame Linus Torvalds For Sexual Assault." When Breitbart is amplifying your takes, time for reflection.

## The Ada Initiative

What they actually were: A women-in-tech advocacy organization that promoted codes of conduct and anti-harassment policies — you know, anti-harassment, the thing ESR opposes.

The Ada Initiative closed in 2015. No accusations against Linus Torvalds or other open-source leaders ever materialized. ESR's conspiracy theory remains unsubstantiated.

The honeytraps: notably absent.

Linus didn't even dignify it with a response.

## The Contradiction

The man who wrote "Trust me, if you do these things women will fall all over themselves trying to get at you" later warned men that women at tech conferences are dangerous predators.

Which is it, Eric?

## Connection to TMNN

In `fascist.c`, ESR embedded his political worldview directly into code (FASCIST/COMMUNIST flags). The "sex tips" and "honeytrap" writings show the same tendency: inject personal ideology into technical spaces.

He can't write code without writing manifestos. Every space is a soapbox.
