        Ask him why he never shipped let alone shared the source code of his 
        unfinished magnum dopeus Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtle NetNews Reader, 
        which he would drone on and on about endlessly and insufferably to 
        people he cornered at science fiction conventions in the 80's, but 
        never finished or released or shared with any bazaar or cathedral.
      key_points:
        - "magnum dopeus" - deliberate malapropism
        - "drone on and on endlessly and insufferably"
        - "cornered at science fiction conventions"
        - "never finished or released or shared"
        - "any bazaar or cathedral" - pointing out his hypocrisy

        batshit crazy smarmy arrogant self-aggrandizing sexist racist 
        anti-black homophobic Islamophobic neocon interventionist 
        libertarian gun nut

    code_quality_assessment:
      quote: |
        the code ESR has written himself is mediocre and lackluster at best, 
        and trivial and unimportant in comparison to RMS's
        
    jargon_file_critique:
      quote: |
        Real hackers from the MIT-AI lab where it originated consider his 
        revisionist politically slanted rewriting-for-profit of the Hacker's 
        Dictionary to be disrespectful parasitical vandalism that doesn't 
        represent the actual hacker culture, just a tool he hijacked, 
        corrupted, and abused to spread his right-wing political ideology.
        
    many_eyes_critique:
      quote: |
        He made up the ridiculous "many eyes" quote himself, then misnamed it 
        "Linus's Law" to avoid personal responsibility and shift the blame to 
        innocent Linus Torvalds, who never said such a stupid thing

    quote: |
      the last straw was probably his intensely sour body odor and lack of 
      hygiene the last time he cornered me at a science fiction convention 
      in the 1980's to relentlessly yap about his Teenage Mutant Ninja 
      Turtle NetNews Reader

        written by Pepé Le Pew.

        I send RMS the Copyleft (L) sticker in 1984, when I knew both RMS

    tmnn_details:
      quote: |
        ESR never freed or shared the source code of TMNTNNR or collaborated 
        with anyone on it: it was his own failed proprietary closed source 
        "cathedral" project, that he was notorious for insufferably and 
        arrogantly bragging about during the 80's, but never releasing, and 
        finally giving up on because he didn't have the skills to finish and 
        deliver it, and nobody wanted to collaborate with him or listen to 
        him talk about it any more.

      Oh right, let's hear some of that "many eyes" crap again. My favorite 
      part of the "many eyes" argument is how few bugs were found by the two 
      eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement). All the many eyes are 
      apparently attached to a lot of hands that type lots of words about 
      many eyes, and never actually audit code.

      CatB was waved around (not sure that the most ardent wavers actually 
      read it) inside Netscape in late 1997 as a gesture to support the 
      argument for doing mozilla dot org.

      Hey Don? I've seen this post of yours more than once, so I'm assuming 
      you've got it saved somewhere, ready to go whenever the Flute gets 
      mentioned.
