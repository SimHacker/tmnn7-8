racism:
  # Bell Curve / IQ racism

  blacks_and_iq:
    quote: |
      In the U.S., blacks are 12% of the population but commit 50% of violent
      crimes; can anyone honestly think this is unconnected to the fact that
      they average 15 points of IQ lower than the general population? That
      stupid people are more violent is a fact independent of skin color.

  blacks_cant_be_trained:
    quote: |
      The minimum level of training required to make someone effective as a
      self defense shooter is not very high... unfortunately, this doesn't
      cover the BLM crowd, which would have an average IQ of 85 if it's
      statistically representative of American blacks as a whole. I've never
      tried to train anyone that dim and wouldn't want to.

    quote: |
      The average IQ of the Haitian population is 67... Haiti is, quite
      literally, a country full of violent idiots.

  black_programmers:
    quote: |
      what's keeping women in general from occupying the vast middle of the
      programming field is not general intelligence. On the other hand, the
      average black American has an IQ about 85 and that is pretty much a
      disqualifier right there. Only the cohort of their bell curve above
      3 STDs from median has much hope of matching the capability of the
      average white programmer.

  blacks_are_lazy_defense:
    context: |
      When Russ Nelson posted "Blacks are Lazy" and was asked to resign as
      OSI president, ESR publicly defended him and attacked critics.

      That sacrifice makes me angrier at the fools and thugs who pulled him down.

  police_shootings:
    quote: |
      Police who react to a random black male behaving suspiciously who might
      be in the critical age range as though he is an near-imminent lethal
      threat, are being rational, not racist.

islamophobia:
  destroy_islamic_culture:
    quote: |
      A clash of civilizations driven by the failure of Islamic/Arab culture.
      I think he [Steven den Beste] is also right to say that our long-term
      objective must be to break, crush and eventually destroy this culture,
      because we can't live on the same planet with people who both carry
      those memes and have access to weapons of mass destruction. They will
      hate us and seek to destroy us not for what we've done but for what we are.

  honeytrap_conspiracy:
    context: |

      orchestrating "honeytraps" at tech conferences to frame male developers

    quote: |
      I'm the crippled kid who became a black-belt martial artist and teacher
      of martial artists. I've made the New York Times bestseller list as a
      writer. You can hardly use a browser, a cellphone, or a game console
      without relying on my code. I've been a session musician on two records.
      I've blown up the software industry once, reinvented the hacker culture
      twice, and am without doubt one of the dozen most famous geeks alive.
      Investment bankers pay me $300 an hour to yak at them because I have a
      track record as a shrewd business analyst. I don't even have a BS, yet
      there's been an entire academic cottage industry devoted to writing
      exegeses of my work. I could do nothing but speaking tours for the rest
      of my life and still be overbooked. Earnest people have struggled their
      whole lives to change the world less than I routinely do when I'm not
      even really trying.

      didn't have an answer to it. "Are you" she asked "the most famous
      programmer in the world?"
