# The BRAGSHEET: ESR's Monument to Himself

The man who would later preach humility wrote this monument to himself.

## The Announcement

The BRAGSHEET opens with messianic energy — a "hear ye, hear ye" proclamation from a guy in his basement. ESR describes his work as a "software construct known as TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA NETNEWS" that "escaped from the secret laboratories of Thyrsus Enterprises."

Thyrsus, by the way, is ESR's consulting company — named after the staff of Dionysus. Even his company name is pretentious mythological cosplay. And those "secret laboratories"? His apartment in Malvern, PA.

After "two years of development" — two years alone, from the guy who would later preach "release early, release often" — this "software construct" would "assume a very public identity as News 3.0."

Spoiler: It never made it past beta level 7.8. "News 3.0" was vaporware. The "B" in "B3.0" stands for "beta" but might as well stand for "buried."

## The Marketing Claims

Each promise in the BRAGSHEET aged like milk:

**"Complete from-the-ground-up rewrite"** — Reality: Built on B News foundation, copied Spafford's code. "From the ground up" means standing on the shoulders of giants while claiming to be tall.

**"Carefully modularized in accordance with abstract-data-type design principles"** — Reality: 774 buffer overflows, global state everywhere. "Abstract-data-type design principles" are buzzwords from someone who uses `gets()`.

**"Lavishly commented for comprehensibility"** — Reality: Comments include "This routine is a HOG!!!!!" and "ugly and flaky." Five exclamation points is not "lavish" — it's unhinged.

**"Full set of documents detailing installation, usage and architecture"** — Reality: The BUGS file lists incomplete features, and the "TO DO" items were never done. The TODO list became a tombstone.

## The Promised Features

The BRAGSHEET's "future" section promised features that would never arrive:

**Hypertext**: A "design for a distributed hypertext service netnews option," with name-dropped advisors like "Robin Hansen" and "Mark Miller" — "leading figures in the hypertext research community." Translation: "I talked to some people at a conference once."

**Encryption**: "A public-key encryption system for authentication purposes." The kicker? "Anyone who has working C source for such a thing is requested to E-mail me." He didn't even have the code — he was asking others to provide it so he could take credit.

**Intelligent Agents**: "Intelligent filtering agents (perhaps starting with keyword-based retrieval)." Note the hedge: "perhaps." Even in the brag document, he's hedging. "Intelligent agents" in 1989 means if/else statements.

**Advanced Services**: "Experiments in advanced logical-network services." Maximum vagueness. Peak consultantspeak. Word salad that means nothing.

## The Cathedral Evidence

Here's evidence of "cathedral" development from the guy who would later write about "The Bazaar":

- **"Secret laboratories"** — for two years
- Named advisors but no co-developers
- No bazaar, no community, no "release early, release often"

He was building a cathedral while the bazaar existed. Then he wrote about bazaars. The hypocrisy is load-bearing.

## The Call to Action

The BRAGSHEET closes with a recruitment pitch:

> "You too can be a part of this epic... The credits list may be waiting for your name!"

No one's name was ever added. The project died before anyone could join. The credits list is still waiting. It will wait forever.
