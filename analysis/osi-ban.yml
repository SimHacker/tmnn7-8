  # Six years of ESR. The organization survived somehow.

  announced_by: "Pamela Chestek, Chair of License Review Committee"

  reason_given:

    # The guy who hates Codes of Conduct got banned for violating one
    # You can't make this up

      - "threatening, disparaging or belittling remarks"
      # His brand, basically

the_incident:
  date: 2020-02-24
  context: |
    ESR rejoined the mailing list after 20 years of absence to argue against
    "ethical" open source licensing proposals that would allow projects to
    exclude certain organizations.
  # 20 years of silence. Then: "I'm back, and I have OPINIONS"

  his_position: |
    Argued against "social justice" goals in licensing, saying OSI's role is
    to "protect a narrow and particular set of liberties."
  # His liberties, specifically

      To hell with you *and* the horse you rode in on.
    target: "Advocates of ethical licensing clauses"
    # A measured, professional opening. Very collaborative.

    penultimate_email: |
      I am not fooled. You are mounting an ideological attack on our core
      principles of liberty and nondiscrimination. You will not succeed
      while I retain any ability to oppose this.
    # "While I retain any ability" - dramatic. Shakespearean, even.

        ESR was not banned for having the wrong opinion – many others expressed
        similar opinions both before and after his messages. But ESR, over the
        course of a few days where he returned to the mailing list, was
        increasingly unable to express those opinions in a professional manner.
      # "Increasingly unable to express opinions professionally" - diplomatic

        I'd even have considered banning ESR without any particular evidence.
        That guy isn't new to the scene but has a long history of troublesome
        behavior.
      # "Long history of troublesome behavior" - understatement of the decade

  founding_to_ban: "22 years"
  # 22 years from "I made this" to "you can't sit with us"
  pattern: |
    ESR co-founded an organization to promote open collaboration.
    ESR was banned from that organization for being unable to collaborate.
    # The call is coming from inside the house

  tmnn_connection: |
    The same pattern visible in TMNN: ESR can write about how things
    should work, but cannot actually work with others. His license file
    for TMNN explicitly distanced himself from FSF, his BRAGSHEET
    bragged about solo "secret laboratory" work, and his code had no
    external contributors.
    # He's been like this since 1989. At least.

other_institutional_separations:
  - organization: "Free Software Foundation (context)"
    note: "TMNN LICENSE explicitly distanced from FSF"
    quote: |
      My action is not to be construed as an endorsement of the political
      or economic views... of any member, agent, or ally of the Free
      Software Foundation other than myself.
    # "Not to be construed as an endorsement" - in a LICENSE file
    # Peak ESR

pattern_summary: |
  ESR has been unable to maintain productive relationships with the
  organizations and communities he claims to represent:
  - Banned from OSI (which he co-founded)
  - Distanced from FSF (in 1989 TMNN license)
  - Jargon File maintainer but criticized by original hackers
  - "Open source" advocate who developed in secret laboratories

  # The common denominator in all ESR's failed relationships is ESR
