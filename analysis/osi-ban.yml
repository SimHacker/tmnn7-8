  date: 2020-02-24
  context: |
    ESR rejoined the mailing list after 20 years of absence to argue against 
    "ethical" open source licensing proposals that would allow projects to 
    exclude certain organizations.
    
  his_position: |
    Argued against "social justice" goals in licensing, saying OSI's role is 
    to "protect a narrow and particular set of liberties."

      To hell with you *and* the horse you rode in on.
    target: "Advocates of ethical licensing clauses"
    
    penultimate_email: |
      I am not fooled. You are mounting an ideological attack on our core 
      principles of liberty and nondiscrimination. You will not succeed 
      while I retain any ability to oppose this.

        ESR was not banned for having the wrong opinion – many others expressed 
        similar opinions both before and after his messages. But ESR, over the 
        course of a few days where he returned to the mailing list, was 
        increasingly unable to express those opinions in a professional manner.

        I'd even have considered banning ESR without any particular evidence. 
        That guy isn't new to the scene but has a long history of troublesome 
        behavior.

the_irony:
  founding_to_ban: "22 years"
  pattern: |
    ESR co-founded an organization to promote open collaboration.
    ESR was banned from that organization for being unable to collaborate.
    
  tmnn_connection: |
    The same pattern visible in TMNN: ESR can write about how things 
    should work, but cannot actually work with others. His license file 
    for TMNN explicitly distanced himself from FSF, his BRAGSHEET 
    bragged about solo "secret laboratory" work, and his code had no 
    external contributors.

other_institutional_separations:
  - organization: "Free Software Foundation (context)"
    note: "TMNN LICENSE explicitly distanced from FSF"
    quote: |
      My action is not to be construed as an endorsement of the political 
      or economic views... of any member, agent, or ally of the Free 
      Software Foundation other than myself.

pattern_summary: |
  ESR has been unable to maintain productive relationships with the 
  organizations and communities he claims to represent:
  - Banned from OSI (which he co-founded)
  - Distanced from FSF (in 1989 TMNN license)
  - Jargon File maintainer but criticized by original hackers
  - "Open source" advocate who developed in secret laboratories
