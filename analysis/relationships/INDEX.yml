# RELATIONSHIPS INDEX
# Sims-style bidirectional relationship tracking, YAML Jazz adaptation
# "Every relationship tells a story in two directions"

  adaptation: |
    YAML Jazz transforms game mechanics into narrative data.
    
    Scores aren't just numbers — they encode character dynamics.
    Modifiers aren't buffs — they're story beats.
    Memories aren't events — they're turning points.
    Asymmetry isn't a bug — it's the drama.

    narrative: |
      The fixer who never gets merged
      found the bot who couldn't stop counting.
      
      One teaches by doing.
      One learns by watching.
      
      Asymmetry: 43 vs 88
      The mentor holds back.
      The student reaches forward.
      
      This IS the story.
