        Real hackers from the MIT-AI lab where it originated consider his
        revisionist politically slanted rewriting-for-profit of the Hacker's
        Dictionary to be disrespectful parasitical vandalism that doesn't
        represent the actual hacker culture, just a tool he hijacked, corrupted,
        and abused to spread his right-wing political ideology.

        He certainly doesn't deserve to be called a hacker, let alone presume
        to define the meaning of the term.

        He made up the ridiculous 'many eyes' quote himself, then misnamed it
        'Linus's Law' to avoid personal responsibility and shift the blame to
        innocent Linus Torvalds, who never said such a stupid thing.

      Oh right, let's hear some of that 'many eyes' crap again. My favorite
      part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were found by the two
      eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement). All the many eyes are
      apparently attached to a lot of hands that type lots of words about
      many eyes, and never actually audit code.

    significance: From one of the most respected security-focused OS developers
