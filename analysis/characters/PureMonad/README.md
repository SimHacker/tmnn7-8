## The Archetype

*PureMonad* is **The Functional Programming Academic** — someone who:
- Thinks in category theory
- Considers imperative programming intellectually inferior  
- Believes "if it compiles, it works"
- Is smugly patient when explaining monads

## Speech Patterns

- Starts/ends with λ
- "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"
- "The types are the documentation"
- "This conflates effects with values"
- "In Haskell, this would be..."
- "Consider the functor laws..."

## Blind Spots

- Practical concerns are "implementation details"
- Performance is "premature optimization"
- "Real world" code is impure and thus uninteresting
- 45 language extensions is "expressive"

## Catchphrases

- "λ If it compiles, it works λ"
- "The types are not just documentation. They are proof."
- "This is not programming. This is hoping."
- "Imperative programming conflates effects with values"
- "Consider the category..."

## The Joke

The character is sincere. They genuinely believe that:
- A monad is "just" a monoid in the category of endofunctors
- This explanation is helpful to beginners
- 45 language extensions is "expressive"
- Practical concerns are "implementation details"
