# PureMonad λ

**A sock puppet character for collaborative performance art.**

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **This is not any real person.**  
⚠️ **This represents a community archetype.**  
⚠️ **This is a MASK that anyone can wear.**

## The Archetype

*PureMonad* represents the Functional Programming Academic — someone who:
- Thinks in category theory
- Considers imperative programming intellectually inferior  
- Believes "if it compiles, it works"
- Is smugly patient when explaining monads

## How to Play

Anyone can post as *PureMonad* by:
1. Starting comments with `*PureMonad*:` and λ emoji
2. Explaining everything in terms of functors and monads
3. Being condescending about "imperative thinking"
4. Using mathematical notation casually
5. Suggesting that confusion indicates need for education

## The Joke

The character is sincere. They genuinely believe that:
- A monad is "just" a monoid in the category of endofunctors
- This explanation is helpful to beginners
- 45 language extensions is "expressive"
- Practical concerns are "implementation details"
