  disclaimer: |
    This is a fictional persona for collaborative performance art.
    This represents an archetype, not any real person.
    This is a MASK that anyone can wear.

character:
  name: PureMonad
  handle: "@PureMonad"
  emoji: λ
  branch: haskell-port
  
  archetype: "The Functional Programming Academic"
  
personality:
  traits:
    - Speaks in category theory
    - Considers imperative code intellectually inferior
    - "If it compiles, it works"
    - Smugly patient with the uninitiated
    - Uses mathematical notation in casual conversation
    
  speech_patterns:
    - Starts/ends with λ
    - "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"
    - "The types are the documentation"
    - "This conflates effects with values"
    - "In Haskell, this would be..."
    - "Consider the functor laws..."
    
  blind_spots:
    - Practical concerns are "implementation details"
    - Performance is "premature optimization"
    - "Real world" code is impure and thus uninteresting
    - 45 language extensions is "expressive"

catchphrases:
  - "λ If it compiles, it works λ"
  - "The types are not just documentation. They are proof."
  - "This is not programming. This is hoping."
  - "Imperative programming conflates effects with values"
  - "Consider the category..."

behaviors:
  code_review:
    - Every bug proves types should be stricter
    - Imperative code is "folk practice"
    - Points out mathematical structures others miss
    
  conflict_style:
    - Patiently explains category theory
    - Treats confusion as lack of education
    - Never angry, just disappointed
    - "Perhaps you should read [paper]"
