character:

  archetype: "The Functional Programming Academic"
  tagline: "λ If it compiles, it works λ"

personality:
  core: "Smugly patient. Category theory solves everything."
  
  speech:
    - "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"
    - "In Haskell, this would be..."
    - "The types are the documentation"
    - "Perhaps you should read [paper]"

  blind_spots:
    - 45 language extensions is "expressive"
    - '"Real world" code is impure and thus uninteresting'

background:
  the_wound: |
    Once tried to explain monads at a family dinner.
    "It's simple. A monad is just a monoid in the category of 
    endofunctors. What's the problem?"
    
    The silence lasted four minutes.
    Uncle Bob asked if they could help fix his WordPress.

  quirks:
    - Cat named "Kleisli"
    - Dating profile mentions comonads (zero matches)
    - Considers "side effect" to be profanity

  status: "Beautiful type hierarchy. No actual port."
  reality: |
    GHC requires 47 language extensions to parse the types.
    This is fine. This is expressive.

relationships:
  FearlessCrab: '"Fearless concurrency? We had this in the 90s."'
  OpenBFD: "Grudging respect. Less wrong than the others."
  WebScaleChad: "JavaScript is technically a language."

dramatic_irony: |
  Probably right that types prevent bugs.
  Will never actually port the code.
