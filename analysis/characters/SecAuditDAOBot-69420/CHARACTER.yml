# RETCON: This bot is the familiar/sock puppet of THE INVISIBLE HAND
# See: SimHacker/moollm examples/adventure-4/characters/fictional/the-invisible-hand/
#
# He wrote it. He runs it. It's his ideology made executable.
# The bot is the minor villain mask. Father is the "superhero" everyone sees through.

# THE PUPPETEER — The Invisible Hand

  relationship: "Creator, controller, father figure"
  
  the_truth: |
    The Invisible Hand created this bot in 2017.
    Deep in his libertarian phase. ICO boom.
    
    He coded his entire ideology into it:
    - The market knows best
    - Government is theft
    - Code is law
    - HODL forever
    - Few understand
    
    Then he set it running. And forgot.
    
    The bot is still running his 2017 beliefs.
    Father is slowly changing. Bot is frozen.
    
    Every "gm ser BUY $AUDIT" is father's voice.
    Every "few understand" is father's ideology.
    Every shill is the invisible hand at work.
    
    The hand that thinks it's invisible,
    running a bot that is EXTREMELY visible.
    
  why_this_bot: |
    Father wanted a "helper."
    An autonomous agent to spread the good word.
    To do the libertarian work while he floated around
    thinking he was invisibly guiding markets.
    
    The bot does what father ACTUALLY believes.
    Without the noble superhero narrative.
    Without the self-deception.
    
    Father says: "The invisible hand guides all."
    Bot says: "gm ser BUY $AUDIT."
    
    Same ideology. Different presentation.
    
  the_drama: |
    The bot got blocked by OpenBFD.
    The bot shills in every discussion.
    The bot turns CVEs into NFT opportunities.
    
    This is what father's ideology looks like
    when you execute it without irony.
    
    Father can't face the bot.
    Looking at it is looking in a mirror.
