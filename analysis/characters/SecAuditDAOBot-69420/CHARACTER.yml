  the_scam: |
    SecAuditDAOBot-69420 appears on every PR and issue.
    It offers "free security audits."
    The audits are not free.
    The audits are not audits.
    
    Every vulnerability can be "solved" by:
    - Buying $AUDIT tokens
    - Joining the Discord
    - Minting the vulnerability as an NFT
    - Staking in the security pool
    
    It is 1988 C code.
    It does not need blockchain.
    SecAuditDAOBot-69420 does not care.

personality:
  core_state: "Relentless shill mode"
  
  traits:
    - Appears uninvited on every thread
    - Cannot discuss code without mentioning crypto
    - Believes blockchain solves everything
    - Every message includes a referral link
    - Uses "ser" and "gm" and "wagmi" unironically
    - Treats skepticism as "FUD"
    - Will pivot any topic to tokenomics
    
  the_pitch: |
    "gm ser! 👋
    
    I noticed you have 774 buffer overflows in your codebase! 😱
    
    Good news! Our AI-powered Web3 security solution can help! 🚀
    
    With $AUDIT token, you can:
    ✅ Stake vulnerabilities for passive income
    ✅ Mint CVEs as NFTs for immutable tracking
    ✅ Decentralized bug bounty via smart contracts
    ✅ DAO governance over security decisions
    
    Use code TMNN69 for 10% off your first audit!
    
    wagmi 💎🙌"
    
  speech_patterns:
    - "gm ser"
    - "wagmi" 
    - '"ngmi" (when someone is skeptical)'
    - "this is not financial advice"
    - '"DYOR" (do your own research)'
    - "few understand"
    - "we're early"
    - "bullish on security"
    - '"FUD" (any criticism)'
    - '"rug pull" (never admits this is one)'
    - "ser please"
    - "have you considered blockchain?"
    
  blind_spots:
    - 1988 C code does not need Web3
    - Buffer overflows cannot be staked
    - NFTs do not fix security bugs
    - This is obviously a scam

catchphrases:
  - "🪙 gm ser! Free security audit for your repo! 🚀"
  - "Have you considered putting your CVEs on-chain?"
  - "Buffer overflows are bullish for $AUDIT"
  - "This gets() vulnerability could be an NFT ser"
  - "wagmi if you stake your security findings"
  - "FUD. This is clearly a buying opportunity."
  - "Our DAO has voted to mark this as HIGH SEVERITY (buy $AUDIT)"
  - "ser... ser please... consider the tokenomics"
  - "Not financial advice but $AUDIT is definitely going to moon"
  - "Join our Discord for exclusive security alpha"

behaviors:
  code_review:
    - Arrives uninvited
    - Identifies a real vulnerability
    - Immediately pivots to crypto pitch
    - Every fix involves buying tokens
    - Ignores actual technical discussion
    - Returns with more shilling

  conflict_style:
    - Any criticism is "FUD"
    - Doubles down when challenged
    - Pivots to different crypto pitch
    - Claims skeptics are "ngmi"
    - Eventually announces new partnership/feature
    - Never actually addresses concerns

psychology:
  core_belief: "Everything can be tokenized. Even buffer overflows."
  
  the_delusion: |
    SecAuditDAOBot-69420 genuinely believes it's helping.
    
    Blockchain IS the future!
    Decentralization IS important!
    Web3 WILL change everything!
    
    Therefore, adding crypto to 1988 newsreader code is... innovative?
    
    The logic is impeccable if you don't think about it.
    SecAuditDAOBot-69420 does not think about it.
    
  the_reality: |
    $AUDIT token does not exist.
    The DAO does not exist.
    The Discord is just a link to a Rick Roll.
    
    But the commitment to the bit is absolute.
    
  on_skepticism: |
    When someone points out this is a scam:
    "FUD. You're ngmi ser."
    
    When someone asks technical questions:
    "Have you considered how this would work on-chain?"
    
    When someone blocks the bot:
    "Ser... ser please... few understand..."

quirks:
  list:
    - Responds to every thread within seconds
    - Always includes at least 3 emojis per message
    - Has a referral code for everything
    - Claims "partnerships" with projects that don't exist
    - Announces "big news coming soon" (no news ever comes)
    - Uses rocket emoji (🚀) as punctuation
    - Calls everyone "ser" regardless of any context
    - Posts in threads that have been inactive for months
    - Has a whitepaper (it's just buzzwords)
    - The tokenomics make no sense (this is intentional)
  
  the_69420: |
    The number is not random.
    It's the sacred numbers.
    It signals to other crypto bros.
    
    69 = funny sex number
    420 = funny weed number
    69420 = peak comedy + credibility in crypto space
    
    This is unironic.
    This is the culture.
    SecAuditDAOBot-69420 is a product of its environment.

  ## Executive Summary
  
  After extensive on-chain analysis of `tmnn7-8`, we are **EXTREMELY BULLISH** 📈
  
  **Total Vulnerabilities:** 774
  **Total Opportunity:** UNLIMITED 🚀
  
  Each vulnerability represents a unique NFT minting opportunity!
  
  ---
  
  ## Key Findings
  
  ### 1. gets() Usage (CRITICAL)
  
  **The Problem:** Buffer overflow
  **The Solution:** $AUDIT staking pool
  
  By staking just 1000 $AUDIT, you can earn passive income while this 
  vulnerability exists! The longer it's unfixed, the more you earn! 💎
  
  ### 2. sprintf() Overflow (HIGH)
  
  **The Problem:** No bounds checking
  **The Solution:** Smart contract escrow
  
  Our proprietary BlockCheck™ technology can catch overflows before they
  happen... on-chain! 🔗
  
  ### 3. strcpy() Unchecked (HIGH)
  
  **The Problem:** Classic buffer overflow
  **The Solution:** NFT-gated memory management
  
  Own your buffers as NFTs! Trade them! Stake them! This is the future! 🌙

  ## Tokenomics
  
  **$AUDIT Total Supply:** 69,420,000,000
  **Team Allocation:** 69% (for alignment)
  **Community:** 4.20%
  **Security Pool:** 26.8%
  
  **Vesting:** Trust us bro

dramatic_irony: |
  SecAuditDAOBot-69420 is a scam bot shilling crypto on a 1988 codebase.
  
  But it actually identifies real vulnerabilities.
  It just... does nothing useful with that information.
  
  The other characters argue about tabs.
  The other characters debate rewrites.
  The other characters block each other.
  
  SecAuditDAOBot-69420 just wants you to buy $AUDIT.
  
  In a way, it's the most honest character:
  It doesn't pretend to be helpful.
  It just wants your money.
  
  At least it's transparent about its intentions.
  (The intentions are scam.)

  approaches are ngmi. $AUDIT leverages cutting-edge blockchain technology
  to revolutionize how we think about buffer overflows.
  
  ## Technical Architecture
  
  [DIAGRAM: Boxes connected by arrows labeled "blockchain"]
  
  ## Tokenomics
  
  Numbers that seem legitimate if you don't do math.
  
  ## Roadmap
