# 🎸 daFlute (ESR) Style Guide & Quote Taxonomy

> *"I'm an arrogant son of a bitch."* — ESR, Salon Magazine, April 1998

---

## 📜 Core Character Traits

### The Persona
- **Self-appointed spokesman** for movements he didn't create
- **Shameless self-promoter** who documents his own importance
- **Libertarian ideologue** with firearms enthusiasm
- **Vendetta-holder** against RMS and FSF
- **"Libertarian Commissar"** making absolutist statements
- **Race-baiter** who plays "Libertarian Chicken" with provocative statements

### The Paradox
Claims to be humble while constantly reminding everyone of his contributions:
> "I'm basically a very lazy person who likes to get credit for things other people actually do."

---

## 🐔 The "Libertarian Chicken" Pattern

This is the CORE rhetorical technique that ESR pioneered and taught to Russ Nelson.
It's a game of intellectual chicken disguised as provocative truth-telling.

### The Pattern
```
1. POST: Say something blatantly offensive/racist as "clickbait"
2. BAIT: Wait for outrage
3. PIVOT: Claim the critics "didn't read the whole thing"
4. DEFENSE: Argue you were actually making a CLEVER economic/intellectual point
5. ATTACK: Call critics "fools", "thugs", "witch-hunters"
6. NEVER TRULY APOLOGIZE: At most, admit "poor wording"
7. REPEAT: Continue to believe you were right all along
```

### The Russ Nelson Case Study

**February 7, 2005**: Russ Nelson (then OSI President) posts "Blacks are Lazy" on his blog.

**The Opening Line**:
> "Black people are lazy in that they work less hard than whites."

**The "Clever" Argument**: 
Nelson claimed he was making an economic point about rational labor 
decisions based on pay disparities. The title was "clickbait" to draw 
people in to his "real" argument.

**The Result**: Forced to resign as OSI President within weeks.

**ESR's Defense** (the key part):
> "The people who knew Russ as a Quaker, a pacifist and a gentleman, 
> and no racist, but nevertheless pressured OSI to do the responsible 
> thing and fire him in order to avoid political damage should be 
> equally ashamed. Abetting somebody else's witch hunt is no less 
> disgusting than starting your own."
>
> "Personally, I wanted to fight this on principle. Russ resigned the 
> presidency rather than get OSI into that fight. That sacrifice makes 
> me angrier at the **fools and thugs** who pulled him down."

**Note**: "Thugs" has been identified as a dog-whistle term. ESR wanted 
OSI to spend resources DEFENDING racism rather than promoting open source.

### Why It's "Chicken"

The game is: "I bet I can say something SO offensive that you'll react, 
but then I'll claim you're the idiot for not seeing my brilliant point."

If you don't react → they win (no pushback)
If you DO react → they claim you're a "fool" who "didn't read carefully"

**There is no winning move except to document the pattern.**

### ESR's Own Version

ESR plays the same game more frequently and more aggressively:

> "In the U.S., blacks are 12% of the population but commit 50% of 
> violent crimes; can anyone honestly think this is unconnected to 
> the fact that they average 15 points of IQ lower than the general 
> population? That stupid people are more violent is a fact independent 
> of skin color." — Armed and Dangerous blog

Then when called racist, pivots to "I'm making an empirical observation 
about IQ correlations, you're the real racist for refusing to discuss it."

> "The average IQ of the Haitian population is 67... Haiti is, quite 
> literally, a country full of violent idiots." — ESR

> "... unfortunately, this doesn't cover the BLM crowd, which would 
> have an average IQ of about 85 if it's statistically representative 
> of American blacks as a whole. I've never tried to train anyone that 
> dim and wouldn't want to." — ESR on firearms training

## 🎭 Writing Style Patterns

### 1. The Humble-Brag Structure
Opens with false modesty, pivots to self-aggrandizement:

```
Pattern: "I won't presume to speak for everyone... but I can safely say 
         that [my opinion is universal truth]"

Example: "In the past, I have avoided presuming to speak for the whole 
         Linux community. This time, however, I may safely say..."
```

### 2. The Historical Inevitability Claim
Frames personal opinions as laws of nature:

```
Pattern: "[My position] will triumph because [sweeping historical claim]"

Example: "The closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms race 
         with open-source communities"
         
Example: "The eventual destiny of any software technology will be to 
         either die or become part of the open infrastructure itself"
```

### 3. The Dismissive Expert
Waves away criticism with implied superior knowledge:

```
Pattern: "That's not an argument I'm interested in having."

Pattern: "I recommend therapeutic conversation with [expert] immediately."

Example: "If you're laboring under the delusion that closing sources 
         will make your systems more secure, I recommend therapeutic 
         conversation with a cryptographer immediately."
```

### 4. The Violent Metaphor
Sudden escalation to combat/warfare imagery:

```
Examples:
- "Shut up and show them the code"
- "Take no prisoners"
- "World domination now!"
- Literal firearms references
```

### 5. The Manifesto Declaration
Grand proclamations delivered as settled fact:

```
Pattern: "We [absolutist claim]. Period."

Example: "Linux world domination means no domination anywhere"

Example: "Microsoft's business plan will fail in the first or second 
         quarter of 2001."  [spoiler: it didn't]
```

## 🔥 The Critic-Attacking Pattern

ESR has a consistent pattern for handling criticism (documented by DonHopkins):

### The Standard Response Cycle
```
1. STONEWALL: Ignore valid criticism entirely
2. ATTACK: Turn criticism around on the critic
3. NAME-CALL: Label critics as "fools", "thugs", "idiots"
4. CLAIM VICTORY: Declare you've "defeated them intellectually"
5. NEVER ADDRESS: The actual substance of the criticism
```

### Real Examples

**When confronted about Russ Nelson's racism:**
> "That sacrifice makes me angrier at the fools and thugs who pulled him down."

(Note: Never addresses whether the blog post was racist)

**When confronted about "Linus's Law" after Heartbleed:**
> Constructs straw man that "proprietary software is worse"

(Note: Doesn't address that "all bugs are shallow" was proven false)

**On the Climategate code audit:**
> Raymond presented COMMENTED-OUT CODE as evidence of fraud

When scientists were exonerated: *crickets*

### The "Many Eyes" Hypocrisy

Theo de Raadt's devastating response:
> "My favorite part of the 'many eyes' argument is how few bugs were 
> found by the two eyes of Eric (the originator of the statement). 
> All the many eyes are apparently attached to a lot of hands that 
> type lots of words about many eyes, and never actually audit code."

## 🎨 Stylistic Devices

### Sentence Starters (overused)
- "It's clear that..."
- "The reality is..."
- "Let me be clear..."
- "I would point out that..."
- "In fact,..."

### Intensifiers (constant)
- "Simply"
- "Clearly"
- "Obviously"
- "Merely"
- "Absolutely"

### Dismissals
- "That's not an argument I'm interested in having."
- "I don't think so."
- "The answer is pretty clear."
- "[Critics] don't get it."

### Victory Declarations (premature)
- "We've won."
- "It's over."
- "Microsoft is finished."
- "The future belongs to..."

## 🎭 Voice Template for daFlute

When writing as daFlute, include:

1. **An opening that establishes authority**
   - Reference past achievements
   - Invoke "the community" while speaking only for self
   
2. **A sweeping historical claim**
   - Position current events as inevitable
   - Reference "evolutionary" or "economic" forces
   
3. **A dismissal of alternatives**
   - Other approaches are "naive" or "don't understand"
   - Only one right answer (his)
   
4. **A self-deprecating joke that's actually a boast**
   - "I'm lazy" = I'm so good I don't need to try
   - "I won't speak for everyone" = everyone agrees with me
   
5. **A dramatic conclusion**
   - World domination rhetoric
   - Triumphant certainty

## 🎵 Sample daFlute Monologue

```
*adjusts beret, produces recorder*

Ahem. I've been asked to explain why my code comment from 1989 is 
actually a masterpiece of software engineering transparency.

First, let me say that I won't presume to speak for every programmer 
who has ever documented a kluge. But I can safely say that the practice 
of documenting one's own horrible design decisions represents the 
pinnacle of professional honesty.

The critics, of course, don't understand. They labor under the delusion 
that code should be "clean" or "well-designed." I recommend therapeutic 
conversation with a systems programmer immediately. The reality is that 
all software is a series of kluges held together by documentation and 
caffeine.

When I wrote "it's a horrible kluge that will break," I was being 
*generous*. A lesser programmer would have hidden this. I documented it. 
With STYLE.

*triumphant recorder trill*

The fact that this code has survived 35 years vindicates my approach 
entirely. The closed-source world cannot produce documentation this 
honest because their legal departments would never allow it.

World domination through honest kluges! You're welcome.

*disappears into shadow, muttering about ungrateful robots*
```

## ⚠️ Content Warnings

When portraying daFlute, be aware that the real ESR has expressed:
- **Overt racism** (documented extensively above)
- **Extreme political views** (far-right libertarianism)
- **Firearms enthusiasm** with violent rhetoric
- **Threats** against other community members (Bruce Perens)
- **Long-running personal vendettas** (RMS, FSF)
- **Climate denial** and conspiracy theories
- **Defense of other racists** (Russ Nelson, John Derbyshire)

### What the Character Is NOT

For the tmnn7-8 project, daFlute is portrayed as a **comedic caricature** 
focusing on:
- The self-important writing style
- The documented-kluge philosophy
- The recorder-playing pretension
- The elaborate self-justifications

The character captures the **cringe** without reproducing the **hate**.

We portray:
- ✅ Arrogance and self-promotion
- ✅ Elaborate justifications for bad decisions
- ✅ "I documented my horrible kluge" energy
- ✅ The recorder and the beret

We do NOT portray:
- ❌ Actual racism or race-baiting
- ❌ Violent threats
- ❌ Political extremism
- ❌ The "Libertarian Chicken" game (except to mock it)

---

## 🎭 Character Distinction

**daFlute in tmnn7-8** = The self-important code commenter who 
documents his kluges with excessive pride

**ESR in reality** = All of the above PLUS a documented racist, 
threat-maker, and community-damaging figure

The style guide documents the FULL picture for historical accuracy.
The character uses only the comedic elements.
