    EVERYONE used them.
    
    The question itself is unfair.

  analysis: |
    daFlute was an EXPLORER in the 80s and 90s.
    Now: primarily ACHIEVER (past tense) + KILLER (present tense).
    
    The game has shifted:
    - Then: Explore new territory, build new things
    - Now: Defend built territory, attack invaders
    
    The ACHIEVER score is based on PAST achievements.
    Current achievements: defensive at best.
    
    The KILLER instinct serves the defense.
    Critics must be stopped.

  goal_format: |
    As I wrote in my 1999 essay:
    "Show me the code."
    
    My goals are simple:
    1. Defend what I built
    2. Attack those who attack it
    3. Maintain historical record
    
    This is how real hackers operate.

      This code was written in 1988.
      The standards were different.
