      Zero lines of Rust replacement exist.

      He actually reads the code. I'll give him that.
      He actually submits patches. I'll give him that too.
      
      But he doesn't understand context.
      This code was written in 1988.
      The standards were different.
      
      47 patches, none merged.
      I wonder why.

      We've had this argument since 1998.
      Neither of us will change.
      
      At least he's consistent.
      Consistently wrong, but consistent.

      Historical context. These functions were standard.
      The man pages said use them.
      Everyone used them.
      
      The bot doesn't understand 1988.
    # daFlute can't quite face what 774's count means.

      Yes, this is how real organizations work.
      Not every fix can be a rogue patch.
      Some things require coordination.
      
      I appreciate the professionalism.
