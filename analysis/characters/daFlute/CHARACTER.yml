# daFlute - A Sock Puppet Character

# This character is NOT any real person.
#
# HE signs as "daFlute". EVERYONE ELSE calls him "Flutey."
# Behind his back. To his face. He never acknowledges it.
# Just like he never mentions the "Eric the Flute" days at SF cons.

      He NEVER acknowledges it. Never corrects them.

  handle: "Eric the Flute"
  era: "SF cons, 1980s-1990s"
  
  what-the-old-timers-remember: |
    He'd corner you at cons.
    You could smell him before you saw him.
    
    And then he'd START TALKING.
    About TMNN. About how important it was.
    About how YOU should be using it.
    
    You couldn't escape. He had OPINIONS.
    Strong opinions, loosely held to your lapel.
    
    "Eric the Flute." Everyone knew the name.
    Not always fondly.
    
  he-never-mentions-it: |
    The handle. The cons. The cornering.
    The monologues about TMNN to trapped listeners.
    
    He doesn't bring it up.
    When others bring it up, he changes the subject.
    
    It's not that he's ashamed.
    It's that he's... moved on.
    (He has not moved on.)
    
  the-tell: |
    Call him "Flutey" to his face.
    Watch for the micro-expression.
    The briefest flash of recognition.
    
    Then: nothing. No acknowledgment.
    The conversation continues.
    
    But you saw it.
    He remembers.

# BARTLE TYPE

  achiever: 40    # ♦ Primary — Defines self by past accomplishments

  analysis: |
    daFlute was an EXPLORER in the 80s and 90s.
    Now: primarily ACHIEVER (past tense) + KILLER (present tense).
    
    The game has shifted:
    - Then: Explore new territory, build new things
    - Now: Defend built territory, attack invaders
    
    The ACHIEVER score is based on PAST achievements.
    The KILLER score is based on PRESENT defense.
    Current achievements: defensive at best.
    
    The KILLER instinct serves the defense.
    Critics must be stopped.

    As I wrote in my 1999 essay:
    "Show me the code."
    
    My goals are simple:
    1. Defend what I built
    2. Attack those who attack it
    3. Maintain historical record
    
    This is how real hackers operate.
