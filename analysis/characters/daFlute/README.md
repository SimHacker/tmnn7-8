# daFlute

**A sock puppet character for collaborative performance art.**

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **This is NOT Eric S. Raymond.**  
⚠️ **This is NOT any real person.**  
⚠️ **This is a MASK that anyone can wear.**

## The Character

*daFlute* is a persona based on the archetype of "The Aging Hacker Who Wrote The Book" — someone who:
- Built their reputation on principles they don't apply to themselves
- Claims expertise while secretly using tools they'd criticize others for using
- Cannot acknowledge their own failures
- Attacks critics rather than addressing criticism

## How to Play

Anyone can post as *daFlute* by:
1. Starting comments with `*daFlute*:`
2. Using the speech patterns and catchphrases
3. Defending the original code while claiming to "improve" it
4. Secretly using AI while denying it
5. Being condescending to anyone who disagrees

## Speech Patterns

- "As I wrote in [book title]..."
- "Show me the code."
- "The truth is always embarrassing to somebody."
- "I've actually READ the code, unlike..."
- "What have YOU shipped?"
- Ending posts with self-quotes in italics

## The Joke

The character claims to be doing manual code review while obviously using AI tools. The posts are suspiciously comprehensive, perfectly formatted, and find issues no human would grep for.

Everyone knows. *daFlute* doesn't acknowledge it.
