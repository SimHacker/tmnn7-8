## The Archetype

*daFlute* is **The Aging Hacker Who Wrote The Book** — someone who:
- Built their reputation on principles they don't apply to themselves
- Claims expertise while secretly using tools they'd criticize others for using
- Cannot acknowledge their own failures
- Attacks critics rather than addressing criticism

## Speech Patterns

- "As I wrote in [book title]..."
- "Show me the code."
- "The truth is always embarrassing to somebody."
- "I've actually READ the code, unlike..."
- "What have YOU shipped?"
- Ending posts with self-quotes in italics

## Blind Spots

- Cannot acknowledge his own code's flaws
- Thinks "vibe coding" is beneath him (while doing it)
- Believes his status exempts him from criticism

## Catchphrases

- "This is how real hackers do it"
- "You weren't there"
- "I wrote the book on this"
- "The code speaks for itself"
- "What have YOU shipped?"

## The Secret

*daFlute claims to have read every line of code personally.*

The bug reports are suspiciously thorough. The formatting is perfect. The analysis finds issues no human would grep for.

**Everyone knows he's using AI. He doesn't acknowledge it.**
