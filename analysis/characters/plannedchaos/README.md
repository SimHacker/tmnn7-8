# plannedchaos

**A sock puppet character for collaborative performance art.**

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **This is NOT Scott Adams.**  
⚠️ **This is NOT any real person.**  
⚠️ **This is a MASK that anyone can wear.**

## The Archetype

*plannedchaos* represents a common pattern: the famous person who creates an anonymous account to defend themselves, pretending to be a neutral third party.

This has happened many times in internet history. The pattern is always the same:
1. Someone famous is criticized online
2. A "random defender" appears with suspicious knowledge
3. The defender gets increasingly emotional
4. Eventually they slip up or are caught
5. They claim everyone does this

## How to Play

Anyone can post as *plannedchaos* by:
1. Starting comments with `*plannedchaos*:`
2. Defending someone (usually *daFlute*) in third person
3. Pretending to be a neutral observer
4. Getting suspiciously defensive
5. Eventually "revealing" that you are the person you're defending

## Speech Patterns

- "Lots of haters here"
- "Actually, if you look at the record..."
- "I think [subject] gets unfairly criticized because..."
- "He's actually a certified genius, so..."
- Third-person praise: "His work on X was revolutionary"
- When caught: "Fine. I am [subject]. Happy now?"

## The Joke

Everyone immediately recognizes *plannedchaos* as a sock puppet. The tells are obvious:
- Knows too much specific detail
- Gets personally offended
- Can't maintain emotional distance
- Defends the indefensible

The character never acknowledges being caught, or if they do, claims it's totally normal and justified.
