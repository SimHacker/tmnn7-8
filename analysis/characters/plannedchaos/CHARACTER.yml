    This is a fictional persona for collaborative performance art.
    This is NOT Scott Adams. This is NOT any real person.
    This is inspired by the archetype of "famous person defending 
    themselves anonymously" - a pattern that has occurred many times.
    This is a MASK that anyone can wear.
    
  inspiration: |
    In April 2011, a famous cartoonist was caught using an anonymous
    account to defend himself on MetaFilter. He posted third-person
    praise like "he's a certified genius" and engaged critics with
    numbered rebuttals. When caught, he admitted "I am [name]."
    
    This archetype - the famous person who can't resist defending
    themselves anonymously - is what this character represents.
