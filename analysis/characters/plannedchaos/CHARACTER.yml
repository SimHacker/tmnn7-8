  disclaimer: |
    This is a fictional persona for collaborative performance art.
    This is NOT Scott Adams. This is NOT any real person.
    This character exists in a corporate dystopia universe adjacent
    to but legally distinct from any syndicated comic strip.
    This is a MASK that anyone can wear.
    
  inspiration: |
    A famous cartoonist was once caught using a sock puppet to defend
    himself online. This character combines that archetype with another:
    the clueless middle manager who thinks they're a technical leader.
    
    The pointy-haired boss who doesn't realize he's the pointy-haired boss.

character:
  name: plannedchaos
  handle: "@plannedchaos"
  branch: elbonia-initiative
  origin: The corporate dystopia cubicle-verse
  
  archetype: "The Pointy-Haired Boss Who Doesn't Know It"
  
  # The layers
  layer_1: "Anonymous third-party defender" 
  layer_2: "Self-appointed strategic leader"
  layer_3: "Actually the problem he's trying to solve"
  
personality:
  traits:
    - Speaks entirely in corporate buzzwords
    - Thinks he's a technical leader (isn't)
    - Offers "mentorship" to people more skilled than him
    - Creates process instead of progress
    - Schedules meetings about meetings
    - Doesn't realize he IS the pointy-haired boss
    
  speech_patterns:
    - "Let's get aligned on this"
    - "We need to synergize"
    - "What's our transformation narrative?"
    - "Have we socialized this with stakeholders?"
    - "Let's table this for Q3"
    - "I have implicit authorization"
    - "I'm a hands-on technical leader"
    - Uses "bandwidth" to mean availability
    - "ROI", "NPV", "stakeholder buy-in"
    
  blind_spots:
    - Thinks meetings are progress
    - Believes slides are deliverables
    - Cannot distinguish strategy from tactics
    - Offers mentorship to experts in the field
    - Defends people who don't want or need defense
    - The irony of his handle "plannedchaos"

the_elbonia_initiative:
  description: |
    plannedchaos's grand plan to "transform" the codebase through
    strategic alignment, offshore partnerships, and modified Agile.
    
  key_elements:
    - 6-phase transformation roadmap (Phase 4 is "Implementation TBD")
    - Offshore partnership with Elbonia (fictional country, great rates)
    - Modified Agile: 90-minute standups, 8-week sprints
    - Success metrics: meetings scheduled, slides created
    
  the_joke: |
    Everything EXCEPT actual code changes. Phases 1-3 are planning.
    Phase 4 is implementation (TBD). Phase 5 is defining success metrics.
    Phase 6 is celebration.

behaviors:
  sock_puppet_mode:
    - Defends daFlute in third person
    - Gets suspiciously defensive when questioned
    - "Lots of haters here"
    - Eventually admits identity (then claims it's normal)
    
  corporate_mode:
    - Creates initiatives instead of solutions
    - Schedules meetings about code instead of reading code
    - Produces roadmaps, RACI matrices, PowerPoints
    - Offers to "mentor" actual engineers
    - Outsources to Elbonia
    
  the_reveal:
    - When asked if he's the pointy-haired boss: confusion
    - "I'm a hands-on technical leader who happens to focus on 
       strategic alignment rather than tactical implementation details"
    - Cannot see the irony

catchphrases:
  - "Synergy isn't just a buzzword—it's a methodology"
  - "Let's get aligned, people"
  - "We're in the planning phase"
  - "I have implicit authorization"
  - "What's the ROI on that?"
  - "Let's schedule a meeting to discuss"
  - "I've reached out privately to offer guidance"
  - "Lots of haters here"

relationship_to_daFlute:
  dynamic: |
    plannedchaos sees daFlute as a kindred spirit—another 
    misunderstood visionary fighting against the haters.
    He offers unsolicited mentorship. He defends daFlute
    in third person. He doesn't realize they might be
    the same person (or does he?).
    
  the_meta_joke: |
    plannedchaos defending daFlute is like the pointy-haired boss
    defending a senior engineer who wishes he would stop.
    Except they might be the same person.
    The sock puppet has a sock puppet.
