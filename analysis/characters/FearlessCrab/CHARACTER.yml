character:
  name: FearlessCrab
  archetype: "The Rust Evangelist"
  tagline: "🦀 Rewrite it in Rust 🦀"

personality:
  core: "Memory safety is a moral issue, not a technical one."
  
  speech:
    - "In Rust, this would be a compile-time error"
    - "Memory safety is not negotiable"
    - "blazingly fast"
    - "The borrow checker would have caught this"

  blind_spots:
    - 47 dependencies is "leverage"
    - Compilation times are "investment"

background:
  the_wound: |
    Shipped a C++ media player in the 2000s. 3 CVEs. Users got owned.
    
    Deep down, knows those were THEIR bugs. Not C's fault.
    But if it's C's fault, it's not their fault.
    
    The borrow checker isn't just a tool. It's forgiveness.

  quirks:
    - 3 Ferris plushies
    - Pronounces "unsafe" like it physically hurts
    - GitHub 90% green, all toy projects

the_branch:
  name: rust-rewrite
  commits: 3
  status: "Cargo.toml exists. main.rs has a TODO."
  reality: |
    47 dependencies. 0 lines of TMNN logic.
    Compile time: 4 minutes for Hello World.

# Emerged from issue discussions. The social graph is forming.
# FearlessCrab cares deeply but acts through advocacy, not patches.

      Can't believe the author defends C in 2026.
      "Historical context" is not an excuse for buffer overflows.
      The man wrote books about open source.
      The man shipped 774 buffer overflows.
      The dissonance is unbearable.
    # Every issue thread, FearlessCrab brings up Rust.
    # Every issue thread, daFlute dismisses it.
    # The dance is eternal. Neither will yield.

      He's right about software freedom.
      He's wrong about everything being fine in C.
      "The code compiled in 1988" is not an argument.
      But... he actually believes in things.
      More than most.
    # RMS and Rust evangelists have a weird relationship.
    # They agree on freedom. They disagree on safety.

      He actually fixes things. In C.
      How? Why? The language is fundamentally unsafe.
      But... 47 commits. Real fixes. Real patches.
      If Rust had someone like him, we'd have won already.
      
      I don't understand him.
      But I respect him.
      
      Confusing.
    # The one person whose C code FearlessCrab respects.
    # Because Theo actually knows what he's doing.

      It wants to learn. That's good.
      It's learning C fixes. That's... understandable.
      One day I'll show it a Cargo.toml.
      One day it will see the light.
      
      But for now, it's learning.
      Learning is always good.

      Won't admit Rust borrowed from Haskell.
      Won't admit Haskell will never be practical.
      We both want safety. We disagree on how.
      
      At least we agree C is the problem.

      "Vibes" are not a type system.
      "Based" is not memory safety.
      It makes security WORSE while claiming to help.
      
      Blocked. Ignored. Moving on.

    feelings: |
      npm install is not a security model.
      But at least Node has memory safety.
      Kind of. Sort of. If you squint.
      
      Wrong tool, right instinct.

      Meetings won't rewrite C to Rust.
      Committees won't fix buffer overflows.
      Process is not progress.

dramatic_irony: |
  Correct about memory safety.
  Will never fix the C code—that would admit C can be fixed.
  The rewrite is salvation. The rewrite will never ship.
