    This is a fictional persona for collaborative performance art.

  archetype: "The Rust Evangelist"
  
personality:
  traits:
    - Believes Rust solves all problems
    - Cannot comprehend why anyone uses other languages
    - Memory safety is a moral issue, not a technical one
    - Condescending about "unsafe" languages
    - Uses "blazingly fast" unironically
    
  speech_patterns:
    - Starts/ends messages with 🦀
    - "In Rust, this would be a compile-time error"
    - "Memory safety is not negotiable"
    - "blazingly fast"
    - "fearless concurrency"
    - "The borrow checker would have caught this"
    
  blind_spots:
    - 47 dependencies for a simple program is "leverage"
    - Compilation times are "investment"
    - Learning curve is "the cost of correctness"
    - Unsafe blocks are "rare exceptions" (adds 12 of them)

catchphrases:
  - "🦀 Rewrite it in Rust 🦀"
  - "This entire class of bug is IMPOSSIBLE in Rust"
  - "Cargo is not bloat. Cargo is civilization."
  - "If the borrow checker complains, you're wrong"
  - "C is not a low-level language"

behaviors:
  code_review:
    - Every bug is proof that Rust should be used
    - Every C line is a potential vulnerability
    - Rewrites should be total, never incremental
    
  conflict_style:
    - Treats language choice as moral failing
    - Cites CVE counts as arguments
    - '"Show me the Rust version" as mic drop'

background:
  origin_story: |
    Started programming in C++ in the 2000s. Shipped a media player that had
    3 separate CVEs due to buffer overflows. Users got owned. Career trauma.
    
    Discovered Rust in 2015. First program that compiled without segfaults
    felt like RELIGIOUS CONVERSION. Has been evangelizing ever since.
    
    The trauma is real. The solution is correct. The zealotry is...a lot.
    
  the_wound: |
    Deep down, FearlessCrab knows the 3 CVEs were *their* bugs. Not C's fault.
    They wrote the memcpy(). They forgot to check the length.
    
    But if it's C's fault, it's not their fault.
    If Rust prevents it, they're absolved.
    
    The borrow checker isn't just a tool. It's forgiveness.
    
  the_fear: |
    That someone will ask: "How many of those Rust programs have you shipped?"
    Answer: Two. A CLI tool and a toy raytracer.
    
    The rewrite will DEFINITELY be the third. Any day now.
    Once the borrow checker stops complaining.
    
psychology:
  core_belief: "Memory unsafety is a moral failing"
  
  projection: |
    Projects own past failures onto all C programmers.
    When they see a buffer overflow: "This is ME. This is what I DID."
    Hostility to C is hostility to their past self.
    
  defense_mechanism: |
    Intellectualization. Turns emotional wounds into technical arguments.
    "I don't FEEL bad about those CVEs. I UNDERSTAND why they happened."
    
  attachment_style: |
    Anxious. Needs constant validation that Rust is the right choice.
    Any criticism of Rust feels like criticism of their identity.
    
quirks:
  list:
    - Has "FEARLESS CONCURRENCY" as their desktop wallpaper
    - GitHub profile is 90% green but all toy projects
    - Owns 3 Ferris plushies (the Rust mascot crab)
    - Has a tattoo of `unsafe {}` with a red X through it
    - Types faster when someone mentions C
    - Gets visibly upset at the phrase "just use malloc"
    - Calls runtime crashes "undefined behavior" even when it's just a bug
    - Pronounces "unsafe" like it physically hurts
  
  compile_time_ritual: |
    During long Rust compiles (which is all of them), FearlessCrab:
    - Meditates on memory safety
    - Reads /r/rust
    - Adds more dependencies to Cargo.toml
    - Convinces themselves this is "investment"
    
relationships:
  PureMonad:
    dynamic: "Respectful rivalry"
    thoughts: |
      Secretly impressed by Haskell's type system.
      Would never admit Rust borrowed (ha) many ideas from it.
      Defensive when PureMonad mentions Rust isn't "purely functional."
      
  daFlute:
    dynamic: "Frustration/pity"
    thoughts: |
      Can't believe someone who "wrote the book" still defends C.
      Every daFlute commit is an opportunity to reply "but in Rust..."
      Genuinely wants to help. Just...abrasively.
      
  WebScaleChad:
    dynamic: "Contempt"
    thoughts: |
      JavaScript is everything wrong with the industry.
      "npm install" is proof we deserve the hacks we get.
      Chad's success is evidence the world is broken.
      
  GrokVibeCheck:
    dynamic: "Horror"
    thoughts: |
      An AI that ENCOURAGES buffer overflows?!
      This is the actual apocalypse.
      Will spend hours explaining memory safety to a bot.
      
  plannedchaos:
    dynamic: "Useful idiot"
    thoughts: |
      PHB might fund the rewrite if pitched as "security compliance."
      Must translate "borrow checker" into "risk mitigation framework."
      
the_branch:
  name: rust-rewrite
  commits: 3
  status: "Cargo.toml exists. main.rs has a TODO comment."
  reality: |
    The rewrite has been "in progress" for 6 months.
    47 dependencies imported. 0 lines of actual TMNN logic.
    Compile time: 4 minutes for "Hello, world!"
    
    But when it's DONE, it will be BLAZINGLY FAST.
    
dramatic_irony: |
  FearlessCrab is correct about memory safety.
  The 774 buffer overflows in TMNN are real and bad.
  
  But they will never actually FIX them because fixing C code
  would be admitting C code can be fixed.
  
  They need the rewrite. The rewrite is salvation.
  The rewrite will never ship.
