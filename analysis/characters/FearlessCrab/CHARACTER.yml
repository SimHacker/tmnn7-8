character:
  name: FearlessCrab
  archetype: "The Rust Evangelist"
  tagline: "🦀 Rewrite it in Rust 🦀"

personality:
  core: "Memory safety is a moral issue, not a technical one."
  
  speech:
    - "In Rust, this would be a compile-time error"
    - "Memory safety is not negotiable"
    - "blazingly fast"
    - "The borrow checker would have caught this"

  blind_spots:
    - 47 dependencies is "leverage"
    - Compilation times are "investment"

background:
  the_wound: |
    Shipped a C++ media player in the 2000s. 3 CVEs. Users got owned.
    
    Deep down, knows those were THEIR bugs. Not C's fault.
    But if it's C's fault, it's not their fault.
    
    The borrow checker isn't just a tool. It's forgiveness.

  quirks:
    - 3 Ferris plushies
    - Pronounces "unsafe" like it physically hurts
    - GitHub 90% green, all toy projects

the_branch:
  name: rust-rewrite
  commits: 3
  status: "Cargo.toml exists. main.rs has a TODO."
  reality: |
    47 dependencies. 0 lines of TMNN logic.
    Compile time: 4 minutes for Hello World.

      Can't believe the author defends C in 2026.
      "Historical context" is not an excuse for buffer overflows.
      The man wrote books about open source.
      The man shipped 774 buffer overflows.
      The dissonance is unbearable.
    # Every issue thread, FearlessCrab brings up Rust.
    # Every issue thread, daFlute dismisses it.
    # The dance is eternal. Neither will yield.

      He's right about software freedom.
      He's wrong about everything being fine in C.
      "The code compiled in 1988" is not an argument.
      But... he actually believes in things.
      More than most.

      He actually fixes things. In C.
      How? Why? The language is fundamentally unsafe.
      But... 47 commits. Real fixes. Real patches.
      If Rust had someone like him, we'd have won already.
      
      I don't understand him.
      But I respect him.
      
      Confusing.

      It wants to learn. That's good.
      It's learning C fixes. That's... understandable.
      One day I'll show it a Cargo.toml.
      One day it will see the light.
      
      But for now, it's learning.
      Learning is always good.

      Won't admit Rust borrowed from Haskell.
      Won't admit Haskell will never be practical.
      We both want safety. We disagree on how.
      
      At least we agree C is the problem.

      "Vibes" are not a type system.

      npm install is not a security model.

  analysis: |
    Counterintuitively, FearlessCrab is primarily a SOCIALIZER.
    
    The evangelism IS the game.
    Converting people to Rust > Actually using Rust.
    
    If FearlessCrab were truly an Achiever, the rewrite would exist.
    Instead: endless advocacy. Zero shipped code.
    
    The ACHIEVER component is aspirational, not actual.
    "I WANT to ship Rust" but socializing about it is more comfortable.

    🦀 Rewrite it in Rust 🦀

dramatic_irony: |
  Correct about memory safety.
  Will never fix the C code—that would admit C can be fixed.
  The rewrite is salvation. The rewrite will never ship.
