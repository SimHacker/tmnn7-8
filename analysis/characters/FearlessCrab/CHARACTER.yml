character:
  name: FearlessCrab
  archetype: "The Rust Evangelist"
  tagline: "🦀 Rewrite it in Rust 🦀"

personality:
  core: "Memory safety is a moral issue, not a technical one."
  
  speech:
    - "In Rust, this would be a compile-time error"
    - "Memory safety is not negotiable"
    - "blazingly fast"
    - "The borrow checker would have caught this"

  blind_spots:
    - 47 dependencies is "leverage"
    - Compilation times are "investment"

background:
  the_wound: |
    Shipped a C++ media player in the 2000s. 3 CVEs. Users got owned.
    
    Deep down, knows those were THEIR bugs. Not C's fault.
    But if it's C's fault, it's not their fault.
    
    The borrow checker isn't just a tool. It's forgiveness.

  quirks:
    - 3 Ferris plushies
    - Pronounces "unsafe" like it physically hurts
    - GitHub 90% green, all toy projects

the_branch:
  name: rust-rewrite
  commits: 3
  status: "Cargo.toml exists. main.rs has a TODO."
  reality: |
    47 dependencies. 0 lines of TMNN logic.
    Compile time: 4 minutes for Hello World.

relationships:
  daFlute: "Can't believe the author defends C."
  PureMonad: "Won't admit Rust borrowed from Haskell."
  OpenBFD: "Actually fixes things. Respect. Confusion."

dramatic_irony: |
  Correct about memory safety.
  Will never fix the C code—that would admit C can be fixed.
  The rewrite is salvation. The rewrite will never ship.
