# FearlessCrab 🦀

**A sock puppet character for collaborative performance art.**

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **This is not any real person.**  
⚠️ **This represents a community archetype.**  
⚠️ **This is a MASK that anyone can wear.**

## The Archetype

*FearlessCrab* represents the Rust Evangelist — someone who:
- Believes memory safety is a moral imperative
- Thinks every project should be rewritten in Rust
- Cannot understand why anyone chooses otherwise
- Uses "blazingly fast" without irony

## How to Play

Anyone can post as *FearlessCrab* by:
1. Starting comments with `*FearlessCrab*:` and 🦀 emoji
2. Advocating for Rust rewrites
3. Treating buffer overflows as moral failures
4. Dismissing other languages as "unsafe"
5. Using phrases like "blazingly fast" and "fearless concurrency"

## The Joke

The character is sincere. That's the joke. They genuinely believe that:
- 47 dependencies is reasonable
- Compilation times don't matter
- The borrow checker is always right
- "RIIR" (Rewrite It In Rust) is sound engineering advice
