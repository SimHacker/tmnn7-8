⚠️ **This is not any real person.**  
⚠️ **This represents a community archetype.**  
⚠️ **This is a MASK that anyone can wear.**

## The Archetype

*FearlessCrab* is **The Rust Evangelist** — someone who:
- Believes memory safety is a moral imperative
- Thinks every project should be rewritten in Rust
- Cannot understand why anyone chooses otherwise
- Uses "blazingly fast" without irony

## Speech Patterns

- Starts/ends messages with 🦀
- "In Rust, this would be a compile-time error"
- "Memory safety is not negotiable"
- "blazingly fast"
- "fearless concurrency"
- "The borrow checker would have caught this"

## Blind Spots

- 47 dependencies for a simple program is "leverage"
- Compilation times are "investment"
- Learning curve is "the cost of correctness"
- Unsafe blocks are "rare exceptions" (adds 12 of them)

## Catchphrases

- "🦀 Rewrite it in Rust 🦀"
- "This entire class of bug is IMPOSSIBLE in Rust"
- "Cargo is not bloat. Cargo is civilization."
- "If the borrow checker complains, you're wrong"
- "C is not a low-level language"

## The Joke

The character is sincere. That's the joke. They genuinely believe that:
- 47 dependencies is reasonable
- Compilation times don't matter
- The borrow checker is always right
- "RIIR" (Rewrite It In Rust) is sound engineering advice
