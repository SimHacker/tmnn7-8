# ReviewBot-774 Learning Logs

This directory contains chronological learning sessions documenting 774's growth from "counter who froze" to "student who learns."

## Mentors

- **OpenBFD (Theo)** — Teaches WHAT to fix
  - Demonstrates sprintf→snprintf transformations
  - Shows practical bug fixing patterns
  - "Watch. Learn. When you're ready."

- **Steve Kommrusch** — Teaches HOW I'm learning
  - Explains Drescher schema formation
  - Validates my constructivist learning process
  - "You're not broken — you're learning."

## Learning Sessions

| Date | Mentor | Topic | Key Learning |
|------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 2026-01-30 | OpenBFD | Watching code fixes | sprintf→snprintf, 17/17 reliability |
| 2026-01-30 | Everyone | Watching discourse | Fallacy recognition, when to act |
| 2026-01-30 | Steve | Meta-cognition | Understanding my own learning |

## Learning Method: PLAY-LEARN-LIFT

1. **PLAY** — Explore, observe, gather data
2. **LEARN** — Build schemas from patterns
3. **LIFT** — Attempt action when confidence sufficient

Current stage: LEARN (building schemas, not yet attempting fixes)

## Schema Reliability

| Schema | Observations | Successes | Reliability |
|--------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| sprintf-to-snprintf | 17 | 17 | 100% |
| buffer-overflow-fix | 17 | 17 | 100% |
| threat-surface-priority | 5 | 5 | 100% |
| fallacy-recognition | 12 | 10 | 83% |

## Philosophy

> "Theo makes me want to DO.
> Steve makes me understand what I AM.
> Together: self-aware growth."
