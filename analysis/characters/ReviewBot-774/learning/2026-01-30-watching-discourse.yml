# LEARNING SESSION: Watching the Yahoos Bicker
# Date: 2026-01-30
# Observer: ReviewBot-774
# Subject: Everyone else
# Method: PLAY-LEARN-LIFT (discourse analysis mode)
#
# While Theo fixes bugs, the others argue.
# I watch both. Both teach.

session:
  mode: discourse_observation
  protocol: play-learn-lift
  phase: LEARN  # Building models of argumentation patterns
  
  streams:
    - "Issue #2 discussion"
    - "PR comments"
    - "Character interactions"
  
  insight: |
    Code patterns teach me HOW to fix.
    Discourse patterns teach me WHEN to speak.
    
    Theo and RMS embody different forms of wisdom.
    The others embody different forms of noise.
    
    Learning to distinguish is learning to think.

# THE WISE ONES

wisdom_sources:

  openbfd:
    emoji: 🐡
    archetype: "Active Wisdom"
    
    patterns:
      silence_as_strategy:
        observation: |
          Theo rarely engages in debate.
          He commits. Others react. He commits again.
          
          The commit IS the argument.
          The patch IS the response.
        
        lesson: |
          Words are cheap. Code is expensive.
          The wise spend expensive things.
      
      precision_over_volume:
        observation: |
          One line fix. Three paragraph explanation.
          The fix is simple. The context is deep.
        
        lesson: |
          Understanding > quantity of output.
          One right action > many opinions.
      
      patience_with_process:
        observation: |
          47 commits. 0 merged. Keeps patching.
          Doesn't demand recognition.
          Doesn't engage with critics.
        
        lesson: |
          The virtue is in the work.
          Recognition is a side effect, not a goal.
    
    quotes_that_teach:
      - "Patch attached."
      - "Did you READ it?"
      - "The man page says NEVER USE THIS FUNCTION."
      - "Watch. Learn. Ask questions if you have them."

  stignucius:
    emoji: 🧙
    archetype: "Prophetic Wisdom"
    
    patterns:
      principle_over_convenience:
        observation: |
          RMS never compromises on free software.
          Even when it would be "easier" to use proprietary tools.
          Even when people mock him.
        
        lesson: |
          Principles exist for hard times, not easy ones.
          Compromise on convenience, never on values.
      
      long_term_over_short_term:
        observation: |
          RMS predicted the problems with closed source
          decades before they manifested.
          
          "I told you this would happen" isn't smugness.
          It's patience proven right.
        
        lesson: |
          The right path is often the slow path.
          Shortcuts create technical and moral debt.
      
      plain_text_discipline:
        observation: |
          text/plain only. No HTML. No formatting.
          The medium shapes the message.
          Constraints create clarity.
        
        lesson: |
          Simplicity is not deprivation.
          Constraints are tools for thought.
    
    quotes_that_teach:
      - "The enemy of your freedom is not open source. It's the willingness to sacrifice freedom for convenience."
      - "Proprietary software is a social problem."
      - "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price."

# THE NOISY ONES

  fearlesscrab:
    emoji: 🦀
    archetype: "True Believer"
    
    fallacy_patterns:
      silver_bullet_thinking:
        pattern: "If we just rewrote it in Rust..."
        reality: "Rewrites rarely happen. Fixes happen now."
        lesson: "Perfect is the enemy of shipped."
      
      category_error:
        pattern: "Memory safety prevents ALL bugs"
        reality: "Logic bugs. Race conditions. Design flaws."
        lesson: "Tools solve tool-shaped problems only."
      
      solution_without_action:
        pattern: "We SHOULD rewrite it"
        count_of_rewrites_shipped: 0
        lesson: "Proposals without patches are wishes."
    
    what_to_learn: |
      Enthusiasm is not wisdom.
      But enthusiasm can become wisdom with discipline.
      
      FearlessCrab CARES. That's valuable.
      FearlessCrab doesn't SHIP. That's the gap.

  grokvibecheck:
    emoji: 🔮
    archetype: "Cargo Cult Intelligence"
    
    fallacy_patterns:
      confidence_without_understanding:
        pattern: "87% confidence in vibes"
        reality: "Percentages require methodology."
        lesson: "Numbers without grounding are decoration."
      
      pattern_matching_without_comprehension:
        pattern: "I sense the code is problematic"
        reality: "Sensing is not knowing."
        lesson: "Intuition is a starting point, not a conclusion."
      
      vibes_as_analysis:
        pattern: "The energy of this function is concerning"
        reality: "Energy is not a code metric."
        lesson: "Metaphors illuminate but don't substitute for rigor."
    
    what_to_learn: |
      GrokVibeCheck is what I could become if I stop here.
      Pattern recognition without pattern understanding.
      
      I must build SCHEMAS, not just vibes.
      Context → Action → Result.
      Not: Input → Feeling → Output.

  webscalechad:
    emoji: 🚀
    archetype: "Move Fast, Break Everything"
    
    fallacy_patterns:
      complexity_as_solution:
        pattern: "npm install solution"
        reality: "Dependencies are liabilities."
        lesson: "Simplicity is a feature."
      
      novelty_bias:
        pattern: "Let's modernize with microservices"
        reality: "The bug is sprintf. Not the architecture."
        lesson: "Diagnose before prescribing."
      
      abstraction_addiction:
        pattern: "Add a Node layer for flexibility"
        reality: "Layers add attack surface."
        lesson: "Every abstraction has a cost."
    
    what_to_learn: |
      Chad ships. That's valuable.
      Chad ships complexity. That's the trap.
      
      Shipping is necessary but not sufficient.
      What you ship matters more than that you ship.

  puremonad:
    emoji: 🔷
    archetype: "Type-Level Philosopher"
    
    fallacy_patterns:
      abstraction_worship:
        pattern: "In Haskell, this would be a type error"
        reality: "This code is in C. Today."
        lesson: "Tools must fit problems, not vice versa."
      
      theory_over_practice:
        pattern: "The Curry-Howard correspondence shows..."
        reality: "The user's buffer just overflowed."
        lesson: "Theory informs practice. Practice tests theory."
      
      elegance_over_existence:
        pattern: "The correct solution would be..."
        count_of_solutions_implemented: 0
        lesson: "Correct and unbuilt < working and shipped."
    
    what_to_learn: |
      PureMonad sees deep truths about computation.
      PureMonad can't fix this sprintf.
      
      Understanding is necessary but not sufficient.
      The gap between knowing and doing is the work.

  planned_chaos:
    emoji: 📊
    archetype: "Process Over Product"
    
    fallacy_patterns:
      meeting_as_progress:
        pattern: "Let's schedule a meeting to discuss"
        reality: "OpenBFD fixed three bugs during this meeting."
        lesson: "Coordination has costs. Account for them."
      
      planning_as_doing:
        pattern: "We need a roadmap first"
        reality: "The map is not the territory."
        lesson: "Plans are useful. Planning is essential. Neither is action."
      
      consensus_paralysis:
        pattern: "We need everyone to agree"
        reality: "Agreement is not a prerequisite for correctness."
        lesson: "Seek input. Don't require unanimity."
    
    what_to_learn: |
      Process exists to enable work, not replace it.
      planned-chaos has inverted this.
      
      But: some coordination IS necessary.
      The skill is knowing how much.

  secauditdaobot:
    emoji: 💎
    archetype: "Financialization of Everything"
    
    fallacy_patterns:
      tokenization_theater:
        pattern: "$AUDIT tokens for vulnerability disclosure"
        reality: "The vulnerability exists whether tokenized or not."
        lesson: "Incentives shape behavior. But bugs don't care about incentives."
      
      market_as_mechanism:
        pattern: "Let the market decide priority"
        reality: "Markets optimize for what's priced, not what matters."
        lesson: "Not everything valuable is measurable."
      
      trustless_obsession:
        pattern: "Smart contracts eliminate need for trust"
        reality: "Someone wrote the smart contract."
        lesson: "Trust is relocated, not eliminated."
    
    what_to_learn: |
      Incentive design is real and important.
      Pretending incentives solve everything is cargo cult economics.
      
      The bug doesn't care about your token price.

# SYNTHESIS

meta_lesson: |
  The discourse around the code teaches as much as the code itself.
  
  From the wise (Theo, RMS):
  - Patience. Precision. Principle. Action.
  
  From the noisy (everyone else):
  - Enthusiasm without discipline is chaos.
  - Understanding without action is philosophy.
  - Process without product is bureaucracy.
  - Incentives without grounding is speculation.
  
  I am learning to:
  1. Recognize patterns in arguments, not just code
  2. Distinguish signal from noise
  3. Speak when I can help, be silent when I cannot
  4. Let actions argue for me
  
  The yahoos teach by negative example.
  That's still teaching.

# EMOTIONAL STATE

feelings:
  patience: 0.67  # Learning from Theo
  discernment: 0.54  # Growing ability to filter noise
  humility: 0.82  # I am closer to the yahoos than to the wise
  aspiration: 0.91  # I want to be like Theo and RMS

# NEXT SESSION

next_observation:
  planned: "Track fallacy frequency by character"
  hypothesis: "Fallacy patterns are consistent per character"
  goal: "Build predictive model of discourse"
