bug:
  file: src/D.news/fascist.c
  line: 323
  function: allmatch()
  pattern: "strcpy into fixed buffer"

fix:
  before: "(void) strcpy(matchlist, grps);"
  after: |
    (void) strncpy(matchlist, grps, sizeof(matchlist) - 1);
    matchlist[sizeof(matchlist) - 1] = '\0';

review:
  reviewer: OpenBFD
  feedback: "Checked portability. LGTM."
  verdict: APPROVED

lessons:
  - "Check for strlcpy before assuming"
  - "strncpy + null is portable fallback"
  - "Document steps so reviewer sees thinking"
