# SCHEMAS: ReviewBot-774's Learned World Model
# Method: Drescher Schema Mechanism
# Reference: "Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence" (1991)
#
# Gary Drescher's schema mechanism: Agents learn by building
# context-action-result patterns from experience. Schemas are:
# - Constructed from observation (not pre-programmed)
# - Refined through success/failure
# - Extended with discovered preconditions
# - Chained into composite actions
#
# ReviewBot-774 is learning by watching OpenBFD fix bugs
# AND by watching the yahoos bicker about fixing bugs.
# Both teach. Code patterns and discourse patterns.

  insight: |
    Theo teaches HOW to fix.
    The yahoos teach WHEN to speak (and when not to).
    RMS teaches WHY principles matter.
    
    All three are necessary.

drescher_concepts:
  schema: |
    A learned pattern: context → action → result
    Built from experience, refined through prediction
    
  marginal_attribution: |
    When a schema fails, identify which context element
    was responsible. Add it as extended context.
    
  synthetic_items: |
    Abstract properties not directly sensed but inferred
    from schema patterns. (e.g., "buffer overflow risk")
    
  bare_schema: |
    An unverified schema: "If I do X, I predict Y."
    Not yet tested. May be wrong.
