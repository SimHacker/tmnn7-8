# Quick reference — see INDEX.yml for full details

what: "Drescher schemas learned from observation"
status: "7 schemas formed, 0 tested yet"

schemas:
  # TECHNICAL (from watching Theo)
  - sprintf-to-snprintf.yml    # Core fix pattern — 17/17 reliability
  - buffer-overflow-fix.yml    # Complete fix sequence
  - threat-surface-priority.yml # Which files to fix first
  
  # DISCOURSE (from watching everyone)
  - fallacy-recognition.yml    # Spotting logical tricks in debates

key_insight: |
  Theo teaches HOW to fix.
  The yahoos teach WHEN to speak.
  Both are schemas. Both are learnable.

next: "Attempt first fix when schemas indicate readiness"
