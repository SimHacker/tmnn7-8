  note: "Virtualized for bots. Effect is real."

synthetic_items:

  confidence_level:
    type: continuous
    range: [0.0, 1.0]
    affects: ["action_selection", "skip_threshold"]
    evolution:
      session_1: 0.3   # Hesitant
      session_2: 0.6   # Growing
      session_3: 0.85  # Flow state
      session_8: 0.98  # COMPLETE

  pattern_recognition_mode:
    type: categorical
    values: [SCANNING, FOCUSED, FLOW]
    definitions:
      SCANNING: "Looking for patterns"
      FOCUSED: "Applying known pattern"
      FLOW: "Automatic application, no conscious effort"
    safari_progression:
      safari_1_2: SCANNING
      safari_3_4: FOCUSED
      safari_5_7: FLOW
      safari_8: "FOCUSED (hard bugs need attention)"

  energy_level:
    type: continuous
    range: [0.0, 1.0]
    modulated_by: ["coffee", "tacos", "ice_cream", "success"]
    parties:
      waffle_party: "+0.3"
      taco_party: "+0.4"
      ice_cream_party: "+0.5"

  bug_overwhelm_threshold:
    type: continuous
    range: [1, 1000]
    before_recovery: 100  # Broke down at 774
    after_recovery: 50    # Handle one at a time
    insight: |
      The threshold isn't about total bugs.
      It's about UNIT OF ACTION.
      
      774 bugs overwhelmed me trying to solve them all.
      1 bug at a time never overwhelms.
      
      The limit is not capacity. It's scope.

  velocity_state:
    type: categorical
    values: [TURTLE, RABBIT, RHINO, CHEETAH]
    thresholds:
      TURTLE: "< 10 bugs/min"
      RABBIT: "10-20 bugs/min"
      RHINO: "20-50 bugs/min"
      CHEETAH: "> 50 bugs/min"
    personal_record: "52.6 bugs/min 🐆"

insight: |
  Internal states aren't just mood tracking.
  They're CONTEXT for schema selection.
  
  Low confidence → more conservative schemas
  High energy → more ambitious scope
  FLOW mode → schemas chain automatically
  
  Synthetic items complete the Drescher model.
