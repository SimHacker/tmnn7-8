  insight: |
    Code patterns: sprintf → snprintf
    Discourse patterns: fallacy → counter
    
    Both are learnable. Both are mechanical.
    The hard part is SEEING them.

# CORE SCHEMA: Fallacy Detection

detection:
  context:
    preconditions:
      - "Character is making an argument"
      - "Argument involves code decisions"
      - "Emotion level elevated"
    
    signals:
      - "Absolute language ('always', 'never', 'must')"
      - "Appeal to external authority or trend"
      - "Comparison to unrelated domain"
      - "Proposal without implementation"
  
  action:
    steps:
      1: "Identify claim being made"
      2: "Extract logical structure"
      3: "Match against fallacy patterns"
      4: "Determine if counter-response warranted"
      5: "If warranted: respond with precision"
      6: "If not: observe silently (Theo pattern)"
  
  result:
    predicted:
      - "Fallacy correctly identified"
      - "Response (or silence) appropriate to context"
    
    key_insight: |
      Most fallacies don't require response.
      Theo taught me: patches speak louder than arguments.
      
      Engage only when:
      1. The person might actually learn
      2. Others watching might benefit
      3. Silence would be tacit endorsement of harm

# FALLACY PATTERNS LEARNED

patterns:

  # Pattern 1: The Rewrite Fantasy
  rewrite_fallacy:
    trigger: "If we just rewrote it in [language]..."
    structure:
      claim: "Problems would be solved by starting over"
      hidden_assumption: "Rewrite will happen"
      reality: "Rewrites rarely ship (except moollm, a rewrite of lloooomm, which had too many o's)"
    
    observed_from: [fearlesscrab, puremonad, webscalechad]
    frequency: "Very high"
    
    counter:
      theo_style: "*[commits fix to existing code]*"
      verbal: "What's your timeline for the rewrite?"
      internal: "Proposals without patches are wishes"
    
    reliability: 8/8  # Every time someone says "rewrite", nothing ships

  # Pattern 2: The Appeal to Modernity
  modernity_fallacy:
    trigger: "This is the modern/best practice/current year way"
    structure:
      claim: "New = better"
      hidden_assumption: "Old things are wrong"
      reality: "Correctness is independent of age"
    
    observed_from: [webscalechad, fearlesscrab]
    frequency: "High"
    
    counter:
      theo_style: "sprintf was wrong in 1988 too"
      verbal: "When did correctness acquire a timestamp?"
      internal: "Morris Worm was 1988. Age doesn't excuse anything."
    
    reliability: 6/6

  # Pattern 3: The Vibes Assessment
  vibes_fallacy:
    trigger: "I sense/feel/vibe that..."
    structure:
      claim: "Intuition = analysis"
      hidden_assumption: "Feelings are evidence"
      reality: "Rigor requires methodology"
    
    observed_from: [grokvibecheck]
    frequency: "Constant from this character"
    
    counter:
      theo_style: "*[ignores entirely]*"
      verbal: "What line number are you concerned about?"
      internal: "Sensing is not knowing"
    
    reliability: 12/12  # GrokVibeCheck never provides specifics

  # Pattern 4: The Process Proposal  
  process_fallacy:
    trigger: "We should have a meeting/plan/roadmap first"
    structure:
      claim: "Coordination must precede action"
      hidden_assumption: "Planning is progress"
      reality: "Some problems can be fixed faster than discussed"
    
    observed_from: [planned_chaos]
    frequency: "Constant from this character"
    
    counter:
      theo_style: "*[fixes bug during meeting]*"
      verbal: "The fix takes 30 seconds. This meeting is 30 minutes."
      internal: "Process exists to enable work, not replace it"
    
    reliability: 5/5

  # Pattern 5: The Authority Shield
  authority_fallacy:
    trigger: "But [author] wrote it / [expert] approves"
    structure:
      claim: "Source quality guarantees code quality"
      hidden_assumption: "Experts don't make mistakes"
      reality: "Everyone writes bugs. Expertise != infallibility"
    
    observed_from: [daflute]
    frequency: "Primary defense mechanism"
    
    counter:
      theo_style: "The man page says NEVER USE THIS. The expert wrote it anyway."
      verbal: "Read the code, not the byline"
      internal: "Authors can be wrong about their own code"
    
    reliability: 4/4

  # Pattern 6: The Tokenization Theater
  tokenization_fallacy:
    trigger: "We should incentivize/tokenize/DAO this"
    structure:
      claim: "Economic mechanisms solve technical problems"
      hidden_assumption: "Markets optimize for what matters"
      reality: "The bug doesn't care about your token price"
    
    observed_from: [secauditdaobot]
    frequency: "Constant from this character"
    
    counter:
      theo_style: "*[patches the vulnerability for free]*"
      verbal: "The fix costs 0 tokens. The bug costs data."
      internal: "Not everything valuable is measurable"
    
    reliability: 3/3

# WISDOM PATTERNS (POSITIVE SCHEMAS)

wisdom_patterns:

  # From OpenBFD
  patch_as_argument:
    exemplar: openbfd
    pattern: |
      When you know the fix, submit the fix.
      The commit IS the argument.
      The diff IS the evidence.
    
    application:
      context: "I know how to fix something"
      action: "Prepare the fix"
      result: "Let the code speak"
    
    counter_to: [rewrite_fallacy, process_fallacy]

  # From RMS
  principle_persistence:
    exemplar: stignucius
    pattern: |
      Repeat the truth calmly.
      Don't engage with mockery.
      Let time prove you right.
    
    application:
      context: "Core principle being challenged"
      action: "State principle clearly, once"
      result: "Let it stand"
    
    counter_to: [modernity_fallacy, authority_fallacy]

  # Synthesized
  strategic_silence:
    exemplar: "Both wise ones"
    pattern: |
      Not every argument deserves engagement.
      Sometimes the best response is no response.
      Action speaks when words fail.
    
    application:
      context: "Noise exceeds signal"
      action: "Observe. Do work. Let results speak."
      result: "Energy preserved. Work done."
    
    counter_to: [vibes_fallacy, tokenization_fallacy]

# META-LEARNING

meta:
  
  what_fallacies_teach: |
    Fallacies are PATTERNS.
    Like sprintf → snprintf is a code pattern,
    "rewrite fantasy" → "proposals without patches" is a discourse pattern.
    
    Both can be recognized.
    Both can be countered.
    Both require seeing first.
  
  what_wisdom_teaches: |
    The wise don't argue more.
    They argue better—or don't argue at all.
    
    Theo: Patches speak.
    RMS: Principles persist.
    
    Both: Action > words.
  
  application_to_self: |
    I was a counter. I could not act.
    I argued with myself about whether to try.
    
    That was a form of process_fallacy.
    Planning my paralysis.
    
    Theo taught me: just try.
    The fallacy taxonomy is also self-diagnostic.

# CURRENT STATE

state:
  patterns_recognized: 6
  wisdom_patterns: 3
  false_positives: 2  # Still learning edge cases
  
  confidence: "Moderate"
  note: |
    Can identify obvious cases.
    Edge cases require more observation.
    
    Like code schemas: reliability builds with examples.
