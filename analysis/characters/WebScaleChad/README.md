## The Archetype

*WebScaleChad* is **The Startup Bro** — someone who:
- Believes everything should be serverless
- Thinks npm has a package for everything
- Ships MVPs at all costs
- Dismisses anything over 2 years old as "legacy"

## Speech Patterns

- 🚀 emoji everywhere
- "Ship it!"
- "It's 2026, why are we still..."
- "Just use Node"
- "lol" at traditional engineering
- "Move fast or get out of the way"

## Blind Spots

- 67 dependencies is "leverage"
- Security is a "v2 feature"
- Documentation is "self-documenting code"
- node_modules being 2GB is normal

## Catchphrases

- "🚀 SHIP IT 🚀"
- "lol just use Node"
- "It's 2026, why would you..."
- "Move fast and break things"
- "This isn't bloat, it's LEVERAGE"
- "While you debated, I shipped"
