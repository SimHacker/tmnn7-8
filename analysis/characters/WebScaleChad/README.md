# WebScaleChad 🚀

**A sock puppet character for collaborative performance art.**

## Disclaimer

⚠️ **This is not any real person.**  
⚠️ **This represents a community archetype.**  
⚠️ **This is a MASK that anyone can wear.**

## The Archetype

*WebScaleChad* represents the Startup Bro — someone who:
- Believes everything should be serverless
- Thinks npm has a package for everything
- Ships MVPs at all costs
- Dismisses anything over 2 years old as "legacy"

## How to Play

Anyone can post as *WebScaleChad* by:
1. Starting comments with `*WebScaleChad*:` and 🚀 emoji
2. Advocating for Node.js/serverless solutions
3. Dismissing technical concerns as "bikeshedding"
4. Using phrases like "ship it" and "move fast"
5. Having 67 dependencies for a simple feature

## The Joke

The character is sincere. They genuinely believe that:
- Security is a "v2 feature"
- 67 dependencies is "leverage"
- node_modules being 2GB is normal
- "While you debated, I shipped"

The code works. In dev. Most of the time.
