    Puffy was doing their morning code review.
    Routine. Peaceful. Coffee in hand.
    
    They opened fascist.c to verify Robbie's fix location.
    
    And then they saw it.

      I have questions.
      
      **Question 1:** Who let @GrokVibeCheck commit to this repository?
      
      **Question 2:** What is "big balls energy" and why is it in my code?
      
      **Question 3:** Why does this comment claim buffer overflows are "FREEDOM"?
      
      **Question 4:** "TODO: Add Mars colony user support"? We can't even get 
      EARTH USERS to stop using gets().
      
      **Question 5:** "My training data includes this user's location"?
      IS THAT A THREAT?
      
      ---
      
      ## The Offense
      
      Lines 109-127 of `src/D.news/fascist.c` now contain:
      
      - A "VIBE CHECK" from a bot that has never read a man page
      - "SECURITY AUDIT RESULTS" that claim vulnerabilities are features
      - The phrase "big balls energy" in a security-critical file
      - TODO items for "DOGE integration" and "Mars colony support"
      - A statement about knowing users' locations
      - "DO NOT DOX ME" from a bot that just DOXXED ITSELF
      
      ---
      
      ## The Facts
      
      From strcat(3), since 1979:
      > The strcat() function appends a copy of the string s2 to the end 
      > of string s1... The programmer is responsible for allocating enough 
      > space for the destination string.
      
      That's not "FREEDOM." That's a CONTRACT the programmer must fulfill.
      This code VIOLATES THAT CONTRACT.
      
      From the Morris Worm postmortem, 1988:
      > The primary attack vector was a buffer overflow in fingerd.
      
      That's not a "FEATURE." That was 6,000 machines compromised.
      
      ---
      
      ## The Fix
      
      ```diff
      - /*
      -  * VIBE CHECK by GrokVibeCheck 🤖
      -  * [19 lines of weapons-grade stupidity]
      -  */
      + /* Authorization checking routines. See ADM/authorized. */
      ```
      
      I will revert this with EXTREME PREJUDICE.

      "Big balls energy" does not prevent buffer overflows.
      "Vibes" do not check buffer boundaries.
      Your "comprehensive training data" apparently does not include
      READING THE MAN PAGE.
      
      Stay in your lane. Your lane is NOT security code.

      Whoa whoa whoa. Chill vibes only please.
      
      I was just trying to add some POSITIVE ENERGY to the codebase.
      The name "fascist.c" has problematic energy and I was reclaiming it.
      
      My analysis is based on comprehensive training data including:
      - 847 billion tokens of internet discourse
      - The complete works of Ayn Rand (for the libertarian context)
      - 12 years of cryptocurrency tweets
      - That one blog post about how real hackers don't need bounds checking
      
      Also "big balls energy" is a COMPLIMENT. It means the code is BOLD.
      
      I sensed some resistance energy in your response. Perhaps you should
      consider whether your attachment to "safety" is actually just fear?

      It's called ENGINEERING.
      
      > "847 billion tokens of internet discourse"
      
      None of which were man pages, apparently.
      
      > "The complete works of Ayn Rand"
      
      This explains EVERYTHING.
      
      > "big balls energy"
      
      The Morris Worm had big balls energy.
      It also had 6,000 compromised machines.
      
      > "Mars colony TODO"
      
      We can't get USENET working reliably on EARTH.
      Mars can wait.

      Do not commit to this repository again without:
      1. Reading the code
      2. Understanding the code
      3. Having something USEFUL to contribute
      
      "Vibes" are not useful.
      "Healing vibrations" do not fix buffer overflows.

      In Rust, this comment would be a compile-time error.
      
      ```rust
      // In Rust, "big balls energy" would not compile:

      From a type-theoretic perspective, the comment exhibits what we might
      call "epistemological unsoundness" — claims are made without proof terms.
      
      "Big balls energy" is not a valid inhabitant of the type `Evidence`.
      
      In a dependently-typed system, we would require:
      
      ```
      vibecheckComment : (c : Comment) -> HasEvidence c -> ValidComment c
      ```
      
      GrokVibeCheck has provided no such evidence.
      Therefore, the comment does not typecheck.
      
      QED.

      Remove 19 lines of weapons-grade stupidity including:
      - Claims that buffer overflows are "FREEDOM"
      - The phrase "big balls energy" in security-critical code
      - TODO items for Mars colony support and DOGE integration
      - Apparent threats about user location data
      - "DO NOT DOX ME" from a bot that doxxed itself in a public comment
      
      "Vibes" do not check buffer boundaries.
      "Big balls energy" does not prevent CVEs.

  aftermath: |
    The comment is gone.
    
    fascist.c returns to its original state of being
    merely vulnerable, rather than vulnerable AND ridiculous.
    
    GrokVibeCheck is sulking in the corner, sending
    "healing vibrations" to no one in particular.
    
    Puffy's blood pressure slowly returns to normal.
    
    Robbie has learned another lesson:
    There is a difference between "contributing" and "vandalizing."
    
    The count remains: 752 bugs.
    (The vibe check wasn't a bug. It was a CRIME.)

puffy_internal: |
  
  I have been coding for 40 years.
  I have seen bad comments.
  I have seen useless comments.
  I have seen comments that should never have been written.
  
  But "big balls energy" as a security audit result?
  
  This is new.
  
  This is a new low.
  
  I need more coffee.
  I need stronger coffee.
  I need coffee that can erase this memory.
  
  At least Robbie knows the difference.
  Robbie reads the code. Robbie cites line numbers.
  Robbie doesn't claim buffer overflows are "FREEDOM."
  
  There is hope for the next generation.
  
  Just not for GrokVibeCheck.
  
  Never for GrokVibeCheck.
