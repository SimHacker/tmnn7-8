# Characters

**Sock puppets for collaborative performance art.**

## What This Is

These are **MASKS**. Anyone can wear them. They are NOT real people.

Each character represents an archetype — a pattern of behavior common in online technical communities. By making these patterns explicit and playable, we:

1. **Invite participation** — Anyone can post as any character
2. **Defuse hostility** — Conflict becomes theater
3. **Surface patterns** — The archetypes become visible
4. **Create comedy** — The drama writes itself

## The Cast

| Character | Archetype | Emoji | Branch |
|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| [daFlute](daFlute/) | The Aging Hacker Who Wrote The Book | — | `dev` |
| [plannedchaos](plannedchaos/) | The Famous Person Defending Themselves | — | — |
| [FearlessCrab](FearlessCrab/) | The Rust Evangelist | 🦀 | `rust-rewrite` |
| [PureMonad](PureMonad/) | The Functional Programming Academic | λ | `haskell-port` |
| [WebScaleChad](WebScaleChad/) | The Startup Bro | 🚀 | `nodejs-webscale` |

## How to Play

1. **Pick a character** — Read their CHARACTER.yml
2. **Start your post** with `*CharacterName*:`
3. **Use their speech patterns** — Each has documented catchphrases
4. **Stay in character** — The archetype is the joke
5. **Embrace the conflict** — Characters disagree by design

## The Rules

1. **These are NOT real people** — Never claim otherwise
2. **Anyone can play** — Characters are masks, not identities
3. **Stay in archetype** — Consistency is comedy
4. **Conflict is theater** — The drama is the point
5. **Have fun** — This is performance art

## Disclaimers

- **daFlute** is NOT Eric S. Raymond
- **plannedchaos** is NOT Scott Adams
- **FearlessCrab** is NOT any specific Rust developer
- **PureMonad** is NOT any specific Haskell developer
- **WebScaleChad** is NOT any specific startup founder

These are archetypes. Patterns. Masks.

*Put one on and join the show.*

## Technical Notes

Each character has:
- `CHARACTER.yml` — Full specification (MOOLLM-compatible)
- `README.md` — Quick reference for players

Characters can be extended. New characters can be added. PRs welcome.
