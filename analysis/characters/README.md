# Characters

**Sock puppets for collaborative performance art.**

## What This Is

These are **MASKS**. Anyone can wear them. They are NOT real people.

Each character represents an archetype — a pattern of behavior common in online technical communities. By making these patterns explicit and playable, we:

1. **Invite participation** — Anyone can post as any character
2. **Defuse hostility** — Conflict becomes theater
3. **Surface patterns** — The archetypes become visible
4. **Create comedy** — The drama writes itself

---

## 🎭 Standard Roleplay Format

**When posting as a character, use this format:**

```
🎭📜 [*daFlute*](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/blob/main/analysis/characters/daFlute/): I've been reviewing this code...
```

**The format:**
```
🎭[emoji] [*CharacterName*](link-to-character): Your message here
```

| Part | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 🎭 | **Theater mask** — "This is roleplay" |
| Emoji | **Character marker** — Quick identification |
| Link | **Character sheet** — Click to see how to play |
| Asterisks | **Italics** — Visual distinction |

**This is transparent puppetry:**
- Your GitHub username shows who YOU really are
- The link shows which CHARACTER you're playing
- Anyone can play any character
- It's a **YES AND** avalanche

## How to Play

### 1. Pick a Character
Choose from the cast above, or [create your own](#create-your-own-character).

### 2. Copy the Prefix
Copy the appropriate emoji+link prefix from the list above.

### 3. Write In Character
Stay in archetype. Use their speech patterns. Embrace their blind spots.

### 4. Post It
The 🎭 makes it clear this is roleplay.
Your GitHub username shows who you really are.
The link shows which mask you're wearing.

**Example in action:**

> 🎭🦀 [*FearlessCrab*](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/blob/main/analysis/characters/FearlessCrab/): This is exactly the kind of memory-unsafe code that Rust was designed to prevent. I propose a complete rewrite. The borrow checker would have caught all 774 buffer overflows at compile time. 🦀
>
> 🎭📊 [*plannedchaos*](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/blob/main/analysis/characters/plannedchaos/): Interesting proposal, but have we done a business case? What's the ROI? Let's schedule a meeting to align on the transformation narrative before committing to implementation.
>
> 🎭🚀 [*WebScaleChad*](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/blob/main/analysis/characters/WebScaleChad/): lol why rewrite in Rust when you could just use Node? ship first, fix later 🚀

## Create Your Own Character

**Want to join the cast?** Submit a PR:

1. **Create directory:** `analysis/characters/YourHandle/`
2. **Add CHARACTER.yml** (use existing ones as templates)
3. **Add README.md** (quick reference)
4. **Choose your emoji** — Pick one that represents your archetype
5. **Submit PR**

**Your character can:**
- Embody your actual views (sincerely)
- Parody your own community's tropes (self-aware)
- Be a total invention (fiction)
- Explore an archetype (theater)

**All approaches welcome.** The cast grows through contribution.

---

## The Rules

1. **🎭 = Roleplay** — The theater emoji signals "this is a character"
2. **Link = Transparency** — Anyone can see the character sheet
3. **GitHub username = Real identity** — No actual deception
4. **YES AND** — Build on what others create
5. **Conflict is theater** — The drama is the point
6. **Have fun** — This is performance art

## Emoji Dictionary (K-Lines)

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🎭 | **Roleplay prefix** — "I'm playing a character" |
| 📜 | **daFlute** — The one who wrote the book |
| 📊 | **plannedchaos** — Meetings, slides, synergy |
| 🦀 | **FearlessCrab** — Rust evangelism |
| λ | **PureMonad** — Functional purity |
| 🚀 | **WebScaleChad** — Ship fast, fix later |

## Disclaimers

- **daFlute** is NOT Eric S. Raymond
- **plannedchaos** is NOT Scott Adams
- **FearlessCrab** is NOT any specific Rust developer
- **PureMonad** is NOT any specific Haskell developer
- **WebScaleChad** is NOT any specific startup founder

These are archetypes. Patterns. Masks.

*Put one on and join the show.*

## Technical Notes

Each character has:
- `CHARACTER.yml` — Full specification (MOOLLM-compatible)
- `README.md` — Quick reference for players

Characters include:
- `prefix` — The emoji k-line
- `link` — Copy-paste ready markdown link
- `patterns` — Speech and behavior patterns
- `blind_spots` — What makes them funny

---

*"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players."*

*"YES AND."*
