# Characters

**Sock puppets for collaborative performance art.**

## What This Is

These are **MASKS**. Anyone can wear them. They are NOT real people.

Each character represents an archetype — a pattern of behavior common in online technical communities. By making these patterns explicit and playable, we:

1. **Invite participation** — Anyone can post as any character
2. **Defuse hostility** — Conflict becomes theater
3. **Surface patterns** — The archetypes become visible
4. **Create comedy** — The drama writes itself

## The Cast

| Character | Archetype | Emoji | Branch | Issue |
|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| [daFlute](daFlute/) | The Aging Hacker Who Wrote The Book | — | `dev` | [#10](../../issues/10) |
| [plannedchaos](plannedchaos/) | The PHB Who Doesn't Know It | — | `elbonia-initiative` | [#9](../../issues/9) |
| [FearlessCrab](FearlessCrab/) | The Rust Evangelist | 🦀 | `rust-rewrite` | [#11](../../issues/11) |
| [PureMonad](PureMonad/) | The FP Academic | λ | `haskell-port` | [#12](../../issues/12) |
| [WebScaleChad](WebScaleChad/) | The Startup Bro | 🚀 | `nodejs-webscale` | [#13](../../issues/13) |

## How to Play

**It's simple:**

1. **Prefix your comment** with `*CharacterName*:`
2. **That's it.** You're now playing that character.

Example:
```
*FearlessCrab*: This code should be rewritten in Rust 🦀
```

### Create Your Own Character

**Want to join the cast?** Submit a PR to add yourself:

1. Create `analysis/characters/YourHandle/`
2. Add `CHARACTER.yml` (use existing ones as templates)
3. Add `README.md` (quick reference)
4. Submit PR

**Represent yourself in the simulation!** Create a character that:
- Embodies your actual views (sincerely)
- Parodies your own community's tropes (self-aware)
- Is a total invention (fiction)
- Is an archetype you want to explore (theater)

All approaches welcome. The cast grows through contribution.

### Tips

- **Read CHARACTER.yml** for speech patterns and catchphrases
- **Stay in archetype** — Consistency is comedy
- **Embrace conflict** — Characters disagree by design
- **Have fun** — This is performance art

## The Rules

1. **These are NOT real people** — Never claim otherwise
2. **Anyone can play** — Characters are masks, not identities
3. **Stay in archetype** — Consistency is comedy
4. **Conflict is theater** — The drama is the point
5. **Have fun** — This is performance art

## Disclaimers

- **daFlute** is NOT Eric S. Raymond
- **plannedchaos** is NOT Scott Adams
- **FearlessCrab** is NOT any specific Rust developer
- **PureMonad** is NOT any specific Haskell developer
- **WebScaleChad** is NOT any specific startup founder

These are archetypes. Patterns. Masks.

*Put one on and join the show.*

## Technical Notes

Each character has:
- `CHARACTER.yml` — Full specification (MOOLLM-compatible)
- `README.md` — Quick reference for players

Characters can be extended. New characters can be added. PRs welcome.
