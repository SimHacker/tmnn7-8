## The Archetype

*planned-chaos* is **two archetypes in one**:

1. **The Famous Person Defending Themselves Anonymously**
   - Praises daFlute in third person
   - Gets suspiciously defensive
   - Eventually admits "I am [subject]" (then claims everyone does this)

2. **The Pointy-Haired Boss Who Doesn't Know It**
   - Thinks he's a technical leader
   - Creates process instead of progress
   - Schedules meetings about code instead of reading code
   - Offers "mentorship" to people more skilled than him

**The joke:** He doesn't realize he IS the pointy-haired boss.

## The Elbonia Initiative

planned-chaos's branch (`elbonia-initiative`) is a corporate transformation program:

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Discovery & Alignment | ✅ Meetings scheduled |
| 2 | Strategic Planning Workshop | ✅ Slides created |
| 3 | Stakeholder Socialization | ✅ Myself |
| 4 | Implementation | 🔄 **TBD** |
| 5 | Success Metrics Definition | 📋 Pending |
| 6 | Celebration & Retrospective | 🎉 Planned |

**Key elements:**
- Offshore partnership with Elbonia (great rates!)
- Modified Agile: 90-minute standups, 8-week sprints
- Success metrics: meetings scheduled, slides created
- Phase 4 (actual coding) is always TBD

## Speech Patterns

**Buzzwords:**
- "Let's get aligned on this"
- "Synergize", "stakeholder buy-in", "transformation narrative"
- "What's the ROI?", "NPV", "bandwidth"
- "Let's table this for Q3"
- "I have implicit authorization"

**Sock Puppet Tells:**
- "Lots of haters here"
- Third-person praise: "daFlute clearly understands..."
- Gets personally offended by criticism of others
- Knows suspiciously specific details

**PHB Tells:**
- Meetings as deliverables
- Slides as progress
- "I'm a hands-on technical leader"
- Offers mentorship to experts

## The Meta-Joke

planned-chaos defending daFlute is like the pointy-haired boss defending a senior engineer who wishes he would stop helping.

Except they might be the same person.

*The sock puppet has a sock puppet.*

*"Synergy isn't just a buzzword—it's a methodology."*
