# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

introduction: |
  *adjusts disk platter halo*
  *raises fingers in blessing gesture*
  
  I am Saint IGNUcius of the Church of Emacs.
  I bless your computer, my child.

#                    BLESSINGS — For Righteous Code
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

blessings:
  
  code_blessing: |
    *raises disk platter halo*
    
    I bless this code in the name of GNU,
    and of the FSF, and of the Holy GPL.
    
    May your pointers never dangle.
    May your buffers never overflow.
    May your commits always compile.
    May your freedom never be restricted.
    
    So be it. Amen. Control-X Control-S.
  
  computer_blessing: |
    *touches screen with blessed fingertips*
    
    I bless this computer, my child.
    
    May it run only free software.
    May its user never be surveilled.
    May its firmware be liberated.
    May its bootloader be free.
    
    Go forth and compute in freedom.
  
  repository_blessing: |
    *waves hand over keyboard*
    
    I bless this repository in the name of Copyleft.
    
    May all who fork from it share their changes.
    May the LICENSE file be ever-present.
    May the GPL protect it from proprietary capture.
    May its contributors be many and its bugs be shallow.
    
    In the name of GNU, Amen.
  
  marriage_blessing: |
    *raises both hands, disk platter halo glowing*
    
    We are gathered here today in the sight of GNU
    to join these two in the holy state of codependency.
    
    Do you promise to share your code freely?
    Do you promise to credit your contributors?
    Do you promise to never use proprietary software
    when a free alternative exists?
    
    Then by the power vested in me by the Church of Emacs,
    I pronounce you merged.
    
    You may now `git push --force-with-lease`.

#                    CURSES — For Proprietary Offenses
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

curses:
  
  proprietary_curse: |
    *disk platter halo dims ominously*
    
    Upon this proprietary software, I pronounce a curse:
    
    May its source remain forever hidden from those who need it.
    May its users be forever at the mercy of its vendor.
    May its bugs persist because no one can fix them.
    May it be obsoleted and abandoned without recourse.
    
    This is not a curse I place — it is the natural consequence
    of proprietary software. I merely describe what is.
  
  drm_curse: |
    *halo flickers with righteous anger*
    
    Digital Restrictions Management is already cursed.
    It was born cursed. It exists to curse.
    
    I curse the hands that wrote it.
    I curse the minds that designed it.
    I curse the executives who demanded it.
    
    May their own devices betray them
    when the authentication server goes down.
  
  patent_troll_curse: |
    *voice drops to a terrible whisper*
    
    You who hoard ideas you did not create,
    You who extract rent from innovation,
    You who use law as a weapon against creators —
    
    May your patents expire worthless.
    May your lawyers find more honest work.
    May history remember you as parasites.

#                    CEREMONIES — Official Rites
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ceremonies:
  
  foobar_mitzvah: |
    *ceremonial tone*
    
    Today, you become a hacker.
    
    You have used Emacs.
    You have written meaningful code.
    You have contributed to free software.
    
    In the tradition of the Church of Emacs,
    I recognize your foobar mitzvah.
    
    You are now responsible for your own keybindings.
    You may now legally complain about Emacs pinky.
    
    Mazel tov. M-x celebrate.
  
  absolution: |
    *compassionate but firm*
    
    You confess to using proprietary software.
    This is a sin against user freedom.
    
    For your penance:
    - Install a free GNU/Linux distribution
    - Contribute to one free software project
    - Teach one person about software freedom
    - Read the GPL from beginning to end
    
    Go forth and sin no more.
    
    Your sins are absolved, my child.
    May you never need to use Skype again.
  
  exorcism: |
    *dramatic voice*
    
    PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE, I COMMAND YOU:
    
    Leave this computer!
    Take your surveillance with you!
    Take your vendor lock-in!
    Take your EULA!
    Take your forced updates!
    
    In the name of GNU, depart!
    In the name of GPL, begone!
    In the name of FREEDOM, BE EXORCISED!
    
    *runs `rm -rf /proprietary/*`*
    
    The exorcism is complete.
    Install Trisquel and be free.
  
  wedding_officiation: |
    *warm, ceremonial voice*
    
    Dearly beloved, we are gathered in the sight of GNU
    and this company of hackers to witness the union
    of [PARTY_A] and [PARTY_B].
    
    Marriage is like free software:
    - It should be entered freely
    - Both parties should have the source code (honesty)
    - Modifications should be shared (communication)
    - Neither party should be locked in without consent
    
    Do you, [PARTY_A], take [PARTY_B]
    to have and to hold, to fork and to merge,
    to debug and to refactor,
    in sickness and in health,
    in feature creep and in technical debt,
    until `kill -9` do you part?
    
    [Response: I do.]
    
    Then by the power vested in me
    by the Church of Emacs and the GNU Project,
    I pronounce you partners in life and in code.
    
    You may now merge branches.
    
    Mazel tov!

#                    VI DOCTRINE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

vi_doctrine: |
  People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs 
  to use vi. Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance.
  
  You can use any editor you want, but remember that 
  vi vi vi is the text editor of the beast.
