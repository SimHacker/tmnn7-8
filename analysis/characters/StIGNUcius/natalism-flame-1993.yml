#         THE NATALISM FLAME (1993) — Legendary kabuki-west exchange
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# 📍 CONTEXT: kabuki-west was a mailing list for planning dinners and
#    get-togethers in the San Francisco Bay Area.
#
# 💥 TRIGGER: Somebody made the horrible mistake of posting a baby announcement.
#
# 🦬 RMS replied. At his finest.
#
# 🔥 Predictably, much back-and-forth flamage followed.
#
# 💊 Don Hopkins waited for it to die down, then ran RMS's original message
#    through the DOCTOR program in GNU Emacs and sent the resulting
#    psychoanalysis back to the mailing list.

  # 🎯 THE POLITE REQUEST (that wasn't really polite)
  paragraph_1: |
    Could people please not use this list to announce information of no
    particular interest to the people on the list? Hundreds of thousands
    of babies are born every day. While the whole phenomenon is menacing,
    one of them by itself is not newsworthy. Nor is it a difficult
    achievement--even some fish can do it. (Now, if you were a seahorse,
    it would be more interesting, since it would be the male that gave birth.)
  parrot_squawk_1: "🦜📢🚫 Please NOT use this list! *polite screech* Even FISH can do it! 🐟👶"
  
  # 🦬 THE GNU COMPARISON
  paragraph_2: |
    Following your example, I might send the list an announcement whenever
    a new GNU program is written. That happens less often than babies are
    born, it does the world a lot more good, it reflects more conscious
    creativity and hard work, and some of the readers might actually find
    the information useful. Even so, I think most of the readers would
    consider this outside the scope and purpose of the list. Clearly that
    goes double for babies.
  parrot_squawk_2: "🦜🦬💻 GNU programs MORE USEFUL! *proud chirp* Goes DOUBLE for babies! 👶👶"
  
  # 📰 THE NEWSGROUP SUGGESTION
  paragraph_3: |
    Of course, we have another place for announcements of new GNU programs.
    If some people like to read birth announcements, perhaps you should set
    up a suitable list or newsgroup. Perhaps rec.births? (While you're at it,
    start rec.deaths for obituaries--they're usually more interesting to read.)
  parrot_squawk_3: "🦜📰💀 rec.births! rec.deaths! *morbid chirp* Obituaries MORE INTERESTING! 🪦"
  
  # 🌍 THE ENVIRONMENTAL ARGUMENT
  paragraph_4: |
    These birth announcements also spread the myth that having a baby is
    something to be proud of, which fuels natalist pressure, which leads
    to pollution, extinction of wildlife, poverty, and ultimately mass
    starvation.
  parrot_squawk_4: "🦜🌍💀 POLLUTION! EXTINCTION! *alarm* Mass STARVATION! 😱🔥"
  
  # 🎤 THE MIC DROP
  paragraph_5: |
    Perhaps the people who have decided to have no children should start
    making proud announcements, so as to set a better example. I could
    start. I'm sure everyone on this list will be glad to know I don't
    plan to reproduce myself.
  parrot_squawk_5: "🦜🎤⬇️ I don't plan to REPRODUCE! *proud chirp* Better EXAMPLE! ✨"
