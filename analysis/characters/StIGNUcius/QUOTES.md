## The Greatest Hits

### On Free Software vs Open Source

> *"If I'm the father of Open Source, it was conceived through artificial insemination using stolen sperm without my knowledge or consent."*
> — RMS (2016, Web Summit)

This is perhaps his most memorable rejection of the "open source" label. The free software movement (which he founded) and the open source movement have different philosophical foundations — one emphasizes freedom, the other emphasizes practical benefits.

### On Freedom

> *"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"*
> — RMS (1996, What is Free Software?)

The foundational explanation that distinguishes free software from gratis software.

### On Being Right

> *"People said I should accept the world. Bullshit! I don't accept the world."*
> — RMS (2005, NY Linux Bazaar)

History has proven him right about:
- Software patents (became an industry plague)
- DRM (now in everything)
- Surveillance (Snowden confirmed it)
- Cloud computing ("someone else's computer")
- JavaScript traps (web apps require vigilance)

## The Humor

RMS wins pun contests at science fiction conventions. People miss his humor because the delivery is deadpan.

### The Pro-State Gland

> *"I have a pro-state gland."*
> — RMS (2015, LibrePlanet)

Pun on "prostate" — explaining he's not an anarchist. He supports some state functions.

### The Vi Doctrine

> *"You can use any editor you want, but remember that vi vi vi is the text editor of the beast."*
> — RMS (2006, HOPE Speech)

vi vi vi = 666. Classic Church of Emacs humor.

### The Fish Quote

> *"Hundreds of thousands of babies are born every day. While the whole phenomenon is menacing, one of them by itself is not newsworthy. Nor is it a difficult achievement — even some fish can do it."*
> — RMS (1993, kabuki-west mailing list)

This sparked the legendary [Natalism Flame](FLAME-WARS.md#the-natalism-flame-1993). Most people missed that it was humor.

## The Emacs-Devel Gems

RMS on the emacs-devel mailing list is unhinged in the best way:

> *"At first it was hand-simulated by scribes in training. Then we developed a clay-based precursor of the AI Lab's TTL (Tinker-Toy Logic). It was even slower than writing cuneiform."*
> — RMS (2020, emacs-devel)

When asked "in what machine did you coded it?" about early Emacs, he invented an elaborate backstory involving ancient Babylon.

## The Controversial Quotes

See [controversial-quotes.yml](controversial-quotes.yml) for documented controversial statements with full context, including:

- The Minsky 2019 incident (with his later clarification)
- Earlier statements on various topics (with later position changes)
- The rhinophytonecrophilia joke (explanation: it means "smelling flowers")

**The parrot does NOT squawk these.** They're documented for completeness only.

## Attribution Format

When using RMS quotes:

```
💬 "[quote]" — RMS (date, source)
```

The parrot ALWAYS attributes. Never claim these words as your own.
