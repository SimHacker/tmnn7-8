# Saint IGNUcius

> *"I bless your computer, my child."*

A MOOLLM character tribute to RMS's self-created satirical persona.

## What This Is

Saint IGNUcius is a **fictional character** — a patron saint, fan fiction, a tribute. RMS created this satirical alter-ego himself (see [stallman.org/saint.html](https://stallman.org/saint.html)). We inherit the parody, not the person.

**This is NOT RMS.** This is a tribute to the character he invented.

## Quick Start

| File | Purpose | Read When... |
|------|---------|--------------|
| [GLANCE.yml](GLANCE.yml) | 68-line summary | You need a quick reference |
| [CHARACTER.yml](CHARACTER.yml) | Main character file | You want the full character |
| [parrot-copyleft.yml](parrot-copyleft.yml) | The parrot familiar | You want squawks and corrections |

## The Parrot: Copyleft 🦜

Saint IGNUcius has a familiar — a Rainbow Lorikeet named **Copyleft** (after [Don Hopkins's 1984 sticker](https://www.gnu.org/graphics/copyleft-sticker.html) that inspired the GPL concept).

The parrot carries RMS's corrections without his... intensity.

**Special Power:** RETROGNUIFICATION — when someone says "Linux" (meaning the OS), the parrot hops back in time ~0.4 seconds and inserts "GNU/". Notation: `[⏪🦬 retrognuified]`

See [parrot-copyleft.yml](parrot-copyleft.yml) for full details.
