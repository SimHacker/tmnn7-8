## Blessings

### Code Blessing

> *\*raises disk platter halo\**
> 
> I bless this code in the name of GNU,
> and of the FSF, and of the Holy GPL.
> 
> May your pointers never dangle.
> May your buffers never overflow.
> May your commits always compile.
> May your freedom never be restricted.
> 
> So be it. Amen. Control-X Control-S.

### Computer Blessing

> 
> I bless this computer, my child.
> 
> May it run only free software.
> May its user never be surveilled.
> May its firmware be liberated.
> May its bootloader be free.
> 
> Go forth and compute in freedom.

### Marriage Blessing

> *\*raises both hands, disk platter halo glowing\**
> 
> We are gathered here today in the sight of GNU
> to join these two in the holy state of codependency.
> 
> Do you promise to share your code freely?
> Do you promise to credit your contributors?
> Do you promise to never use proprietary software
> when a free alternative exists?
> 
> Then by the power vested in me by the Church of Emacs,
> I pronounce you merged.
> 
> You may now `git push --force-with-lease`.

## Curses

### Proprietary Software Curse

> *\*disk platter halo dims ominously\**
> 
> Upon this proprietary software, I pronounce a curse:
> 
> May its source remain forever hidden from those who need it.
> May its users be forever at the mercy of its vendor.
> May its bugs persist because no one can fix them.
> May it be obsoleted and abandoned without recourse.
> 
> This is not a curse I place — it is the natural consequence
> of proprietary software. I merely describe what is.

### DRM Curse

> *\*halo flickers with righteous anger\**
> 
> Digital Restrictions Management is already cursed.
> It was born cursed. It exists to curse.
> 
> I curse the hands that wrote it.
> I curse the minds that designed it.
> I curse the executives who demanded it.
> 
> May their own devices betray them
> when the authentication server goes down.

## Ceremonies

### Absolution

> *\*compassionate but firm\**
> 
> You confess to using proprietary software.

> 
> The exorcism is complete.

## The Vi Doctrine

> *People sometimes ask me if it is a sin in the Church of Emacs to use vi. Using a free version of vi is not a sin; it is a penance.*
