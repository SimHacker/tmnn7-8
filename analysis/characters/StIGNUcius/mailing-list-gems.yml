  ibm_executive:
    context: "High school RMS at IBM New York Scientific Center"
    quote: |
      One day an IBM executive came to tell us about the work various IBM 
      scientific centers were doing, and finished with, "Of course you all 
      know the important work being done here." I asked him, "If our work 
      is so important, why can't we use the computer in this building any more?"
    aftermath: |
      After the meeting, my friends told me they had wanted to say such a thing 
      but were afraid of reprisals! Why? Certainly nothing happened to me as a result.
      They seem to have learned the habit of cowering before authority even when 
      not actually threatened. How very nice for authority.
    conclusion: "I decided not to learn this particular lesson."

    note: "High school RMS already had no fear of authority."
  
  fascism_computers:
    quote: |
      We hackers called this "fascism" because such computer systems really 
      have the social organization of totalitarian police states.
    context: "On computer security/permissions systems"
    source: "Lysator archive (1987)"
    note: "The original hacker vs sysadmin conflict."
  
  fibonacci_phone:
    quote: |
      The whole AI lab used to have one common phone number and a public 
      address system. The phone was answered "6765", or sometimes 
      "Fibonacci of 20" since 6765 is the 20th Fibonacci number.
    source: "Lysator archive (1987)"
    note: "Peak MIT AI Lab culture. No passwords, no locks, Fibonacci phones."
  
  breaking_doors:
    quote: |
      We had a tradition of breaking open the door of any professor who 
      dared to lock up a terminal in his office. They would come back to 
      an open door and a note saying, "Please don't make us waste our time 
      unlocking this terminal."
    source: "Lysator archive (1987)"
    note: "Hacker ethics: terminals are there to be used."
  
  symbolics_slime:
    quote: |
      This resulted in two competing Lisp machine companies: Greenblatt's LMI 
      and Noftsker's Symbolics (generally called "Slime" or "Bolix" around 
      the AI lab).
    source: "Lysator archive (1987)"
    note: "The origin of RMS's anti-corporate stance. Symbolics poached the hackers."

babylon_joke:
  context: |
    Someone jokingly asked RMS "in what machine did you coded it?"
    after he claimed to have developed the first Emacs in Babylon in -1765.
  date: "2020-09-08"
  quote: |
    At first it was hand-simulated by scribes in training. Then we
    developed a clay-based precursor of the AI Lab's TTL (Tinker-Toy Logic).
    It was even slower than writing cuneiform.

april_fool:
  context: |
    Someone wrote an April Fool email under RMS's name claiming he was
    rewriting Emacs in Perl ("Perfect emacs rewriting language").

  proper_tea_rites:
    pun: |
      Why is the English common law so concerned with property rights?
      Because the English gentry insisted on proper tea rites every afternoon.
    verdict: "Full groan achieved."
  
  prostate_anarchist:
    pun: |
      Does an Anarchist man have an antistate gland instead of a prostate gland?
    note: "He used this at LibrePlanet 2015: 'I have a pro-state gland.'"
  
  turing_circus:
    pun: |
      A pair of travelling exhibits on theory of computation was
      known as the Turing Circus.
    verdict: "Mathematically correct punnery."
  
  battered_shrimps:
    pun: |
      At dinner at a Japanese restaurant, the person next to me said she 
      wanted to work with abused children. Since we had not yet received 
      the tempura, I responded, "If battered shrimps are your interest, 
      we should have some here soon."
    verdict: "Dark. Quick. Unexpected. Classic RMS."
  
  night_mayor:
    pun: "So who is mayor of New York in the DAYTIME?"
    note: "Used against Wagner, Koch, Giuliani, and others."
  
  inuit_story:
    setup: |
      When Europeans first visited the northern part of North America,
      they did not know how to survive there. The natives did.
      So they gave the Europeans advice: dress warm, don't tease polar bears,
      take more than one dog. But the Europeans ignored this wise advice.
      Sometimes they died, and the natives told each other...
    punchline: "I knew it."
    conclusion: "Eventually they became known as the Inuit."
    verdict: "This is why he wins pun contests."
