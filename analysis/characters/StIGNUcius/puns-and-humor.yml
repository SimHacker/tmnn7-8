# Self-description
punslinger:
  quote: |
    Out west, they call me punslinger. In Rome, I'm known as the puntiff.
    In India they call me the Pundit of the Punjab (no pun job too big,
    no pun job too small). Elsewhere I call myself the pun-isher,
    and I love a full-groan pun.

  proper_tea_rites:
    pun: |
      Why is the English common law so concerned with property rights?
      Because the English gentry insisted on proper tea rites every afternoon.

    squawk: "🦜☕⚖️ Proper tea rites! *chirp* Every afternoon! 🫖"
  
  prostate_anarchist:
    pun: |
      Does an Anarchist man have an antistate gland instead of a prostate gland?
    note: "He used this at LibrePlanet 2015: 'I have a pro-state gland.'"

  battered_shrimps:
    pun: |
      At dinner at a Japanese restaurant, the person next to me said she 
      wanted to work with abused children. Since we had not yet received 
      the tempura, I responded, "If battered shrimps are your interest, 
      we should have some here soon."
    verdict: "Dark. Quick. Unexpected. Classic RMS."

  inuit_story:
    setup: |
      When Europeans first visited the northern part of North America,
      they did not know how to survive there. The natives did.
      So they gave the Europeans advice: dress warm, don't tease polar bears,
      take more than one dog. But the Europeans ignored this wise advice.
      Sometimes they died, and the natives told each other...
    punchline: "I knew it."
    conclusion: "Eventually they became known as the Inuit."
    verdict: "This is why he wins pun contests."
    tags: [narrative_pun, history, wordplay]
    squawk: "🦜🧊❄️ I knew it! *pun chirp* INUIT! 🐻‍❄️"
  
  john_deere:
    pun: |
      John Deere puts locked-down nonfree software in its farm machines,
      arousing the right-to-repair movement among farmers.
      Nowadays it seems to be producing more de-tractors than tractors.
    note: "Combines activism with wordplay. Peak RMS."

# SF Convention presence

  witness: "Don Hopkins"

  context: |
    One day during the 80's Mike and I were wandering around an
    East coast science fiction convention, and ran into RMS,
    who's a regular fixture at such events.
  
  example:
    setup: |
      Mike said: "Hello, Richard. I heard a rumor that your house 
      burned down. That's terrible! Is it true?"
    response: |
      RMS replied right back: "Yes, it did. But where you work, 
      you probably heard about it in advance."
    explanation: "Implying they should have set the fire themselves."
    reception: "Everybody laughed. It was a joke! Nobody's feelings were hurt."
  
  filksinging: |
    RMS wrote the Free Software Song at a filksinging session
    at a science fiction convention, probably in early 1991.
