    - quote: "Tcl was not designed to be a serious programming language. It was designed to be a 'scripting language', on the assumption that a 'scripting language' need not try to be a real programming language."

      note: "The post that started the war."
    
    - quote: "The principal lesson of Emacs is that a language for extensions should not be a mere 'extension language'. It should be a real programming language, designed for writing and maintaining substantial programs. Because people will want to do that!"

      note: "Specific technical objections."
    
    - quote: "Tcl has a peculiar syntax that appeals to hackers because of its simplicity. But Tcl syntax seems strange to most users. If Tcl does become the 'standard scripting language', users will curse it for years--the way people curse Fortran, MSDOS, Unix shell syntax, and other de facto standards they feel stuck with."

  key_quotes:
    - quote: "I'd like to encourage everyone to keep their responses cordial and technical, rather than personal, regardless of how strong your opinions are."
      squawk: "🦜🤝📊 Keep it TECHNICAL! *diplomatic chirp* Cordial! 🕊️"
      note: "Opening with a plea for civility. (Unlike the natalism thread.)"
    
    - quote: "I think that Stallman's objections to Tcl may stem largely from one aspect of Tcl's design that he either doesn't understand or doesn't agree with. This is the proposition that you should use *two* languages for a large software system."
      squawk: "🦜2️⃣💻 TWO languages! *thoughtful whistle* C plus scripting! 🔧"
      note: "The two-language philosophy. System language + scripting language."
    
    - quote: "I didn't design Tcl for building huge programs with 10's or 100's of thousands of lines of Tcl, and I've been pretty surprised that people have used it for huge programs."
      squawk: "🦜😮📈 Surprised people use it HUGE! *amazed chirp* Not intended! 🤷"
      note: "Honest about design scope. Users exceeded expectations."
    
    - quote: "Language designers love to argue about why this language or that language *must* be better or worse a priori, but none of these arguments really matter a lot. Ultimately all language issues get settled when users vote with their feet."
      squawk: "🦜🗳️👣 VOTE WITH FEET! *wise bob* The LAW! ⚖️"
      note: "OUSTERHOUT'S LAW — The market decides language success."
    
    - quote: "The Law says to me that Scheme (or any other Lisp dialect) is probably not the 'right' language: too many people have voted with their feet over the last 30 years."
      squawk: "🦜🦶❌ Scheme LOST the vote! *pointed chirp* 30 years! 📉"
      note: "Counter-jab at Lisp. RMS advocated Scheme-based extension."

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#                    THE OUTCOME 🎬
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

outcome:
  guile_announced: "1994-10-18"
  guile_link: "https://vanderburg.org/old_pages/Tcl/war2/index.html"
  resolution: "The war ended when GNU announced GUILE as their extension language"
  
  # 🎭 THE IRONY: GUILE was vaporware for ~20 years.
  # Meanwhile Lua was born quietly and won the market.
  
  irony: |
    HN commenter NelsonMinar (2016): "The Guile vaporware was the first time
    I really lost respect for Stallman and the FSF. It's incredibly damaging
    to say 'don't use TCL use Guile instead' and then never actually produce
    a useful Guile product."
    
    Another noted: "Lua was peacefully and quietly born in a manger at the
    Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil" around this time.
    
    Guile did eventually become usable ~20 years later under Andy Wingo.
  
  lessons:
    - "Ousterhout's Law holds: users vote with their feet"
    - "Vaporware announcements damage credibility"
    - "Tcl survived; Guile took 20 years to mature"
    - "Lua quietly won the embedded scripting market"
    - "Technical superiority doesn't guarantee adoption"
