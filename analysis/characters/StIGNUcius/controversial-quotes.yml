  what_happened: |
    September 2019: Internal MIT CSAIL emails were leaked regarding
    Marvin Minsky and allegations from an Epstein victim.
    
    RMS responded on the mailing list with characteristic pedantry:
    - He objected to the word "assault" (vs "rape") as imprecise
    - He speculated that the victim may have appeared "willing" 
      from Minsky's perspective (due to Epstein's coercion)
    - He was defending his friend and mentor Minsky, not Epstein
    
    The press reported this as "Stallman defends Epstein."
    This was a mischaracterization, but the damage was done.
  
  resignations:
    - MIT CSAIL: "September 16, 2019"
    - FSF President: "September 16, 2019"
    - GNU Project leadership: "September 16, 2019"

    controversy: |
      Many organizations (including Red Hat, GNOME Foundation, EFF)
      signed an open letter calling for his removal.
      The FSF conducted a board review.
    reconfirmed: "April 2025"
    note: "Re-confirmed by voting FSF members"
  
  rms_later_statement: |
    RMS later posted on stallman.org (Sept 2019):
    "I want to respond to the description of my message as a defense of 
    Epstein. Nothing could be further from the truth. I despise Epstein. 
    I said nothing about him, nothing to excuse what he did. In one message, 
    I acknowledged he was a serial rapist."
    
    And regarding the specific defense of Minsky:
    "It was about Marvin Minsky, not about Epstein. I said Minsky might not 
    have known she was coerced, and that we cannot be certain he knew."
  
  context: |
    Marvin Minsky (1927-2016) was an AI pioneer and RMS's friend/mentor.
    Minsky died before the accusations became public.
    RMS was defending a dead friend who couldn't defend himself.
    
    This doesn't make RMS's comments wise or well-received.
    It provides context for why he said what he said.

  # who knew Marvin personally.
  
  what_actually_happened: |
    According to reliable sources (people who knew Minsky personally):
    
    1. Minsky was at Epstein's with his wife
    2. The young woman approached Minsky (unclear if wife was present)
    3. Minsky was TAKEN ABACK by the approach
    4. He told his wife about it
    5. He told a science fiction author about it IMMEDIATELY
    6. He DID NOT take her up on the offer
    
    IMPORTANT: The court testimony only states that Epstein TOLD her to 
    offer herself to Minsky. Nothing in the record says Minsky accepted.
    
    The SF author has tweeted/blogged about this.
  
  the_irony: |
    RMS's approach was a terrible idea — but not for the reasons people think.
    
    RMS was (seemingly or intentionally) trying to justify what he 
    INCORRECTLY PRESUMED Minsky did. He argued Minsky might not have 
    known she was coerced.
    
    But Minsky apparently DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. He declined the approach.
    
    RMS was defending against an accusation that appears to be false,
    but in a way that assumed the accusation was true. This made him
    look like he was excusing sexual misconduct, when the actual defense
    should have been: "Minsky didn't do it."
    
    A classic case of losing the PR battle while the facts were actually
    on your side — by arguing the wrong point.

      This quote was cited extensively in 2019.
    
    later_position: |
      RMS has since stated he was wrong about this.
      From stallman.org (Sept 2019):
      "Through personal conversations in recent years, I've learned to 
      understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically. 
      This changed my mind about the matter: I think adults should not 
      do that."
  
  censorship_2012:
    quote: |
      Rick Falkvinge joins me in demanding an end to the censorship 
      of "child pornography"
    date: "2012-09-15"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2012-jul-oct.html#15_September_2012_%28Censorship_of_child_pornography%29"
    context: |
      RMS opposes ALL possession crimes on principle.
      His position is anti-censorship absolutism, not pro-abuse.
      He argues possession laws can be abused by governments.
      This is a consistent (if unpopular) civil liberties position.
    note: "The scare quotes around 'child pornography' indicate disagreement with the term, not the harm"
  
  possession_2017:
    quote: |
      Mere possession of child pornography should not be a crime at all.
      To prosecute people for possessing something published, no matter 
      what it may be, is a big threat to human rights.
    date: "2017"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2017-mar-jun.html"
    context: |
      Same anti-censorship absolutism.
      RMS consistently opposes criminalizing possession of any content.
      This is a civil liberties argument, not a defense of the content itself.

  rhinophytonecrophilia:
    quote: |
      I often enjoy rhinophytonecrophilia (nasal sex with dead plants).
    date: "2003-06-28"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2003-may-aug.html"
    explanation: |
      This is a JOKE.
      
      rhino = nose
      phyto = plant  
      necro = dead
      philia = love of
      
      rhinophytonecrophilia = smelling flowers
      
      RMS is saying he likes to smell flowers.
      People who don't parse Greek roots miss the joke.
    note: "Classic RMS deadpan. People cited this as evidence of deviance."

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

editorial_note: |
  RMS has held unpopular opinions. He has expressed them bluntly.
  Some of those opinions he has since revised.
  Some he maintains as principled civil liberties positions.
  
  This file documents them because:
  1. Ignoring them would be dishonest
  2. Context matters (see Minsky incident)
  3. People change their minds (see dutch_2006 retraction)
  4. Some "controversial" quotes are just jokes (see rhinophytonecrophilia)
  
  We do not endorse all of RMS's statements.
  We document them accurately.
  
  The parrot does NOT squawk these.
  These are for character documentation only.
