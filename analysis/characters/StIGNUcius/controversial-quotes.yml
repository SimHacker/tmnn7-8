# THE MINSKY INCIDENT (2019)
# Led to RMS's resignation from MIT, FSF, and GNU. Rejoined FSF board March 2021; reconfirmed April 2025.

  what_happened: |
    Sept 2019: CSAIL emails leaked re Minsky and Epstein-victim allegations.
    RMS replied with pedantry (objected to "assault" vs "rape"; speculated victim
    might have "appeared willing" to Minsky). He was defending Minsky, not Epstein.
    Press framed it as "Stallman defends Epstein"; mischaracterization, but damage done.
    Resignations: MIT CSAIL, FSF President, GNU leadership (Sept 16, 2019).
    RMS later (stallman.org): he despises Epstein, was defending Minsky only; said
    "Minsky might not have known she was coerced."
  
  what_exonerates_minsky: |
    Deposition (Giuffre v. Maxwell, May 3 2016): Giuffre says she was *directed* to
    go have sex with Minsky and gives location (Epstein's island). She never says
    "I had sex with Marvin Minsky" or that the act occurred. Record = direction + place, not "he did it."
    Greg Benford (there at Epstein's): "I was there. Minsky turned her down. Told me about it." (InstaPundit Aug 2019.)
    Minsky's widow (Gloria Rudisch): denied; said they were "always together," visited "three or four times at the most." (NY Post Aug 2019.)
  
  rms_critique: |
    Bad move: RMS argued as if Minsky *had* had sex with her — "might not have known she was coerced."
    That concedes the act and sounds like excusing misconduct. The actual defense was available:
    Minsky didn't do it (Benford; deposition doesn't say he did). RMS chose the wrong defense and lost the PR battle while the facts were on his side.

# EARLIER CONTROVERSIAL STATEMENTS
# These are from stallman.org/archives, documented with primary sources.
# RMS has written about many topics with characteristic bluntness.

earlier_statements:
  
  libertarian_2003:
    quote: |
      All of these acts should be legal as long as no one is coerced. 
      They are illegal only because of prejudice and narrowmindedness.
    context: "Commenting on a judicial nominee's list of things Constitution might protect"
    date: "2003-06-28"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2003-may-aug.html"
    note: "Standard libertarian position on consensual acts"
  
  dutch_2006:
    quote: |
      I am skeptical of the claim that voluntarily pedophilia harms children.
    date: "2006-06-05"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2006-mar-jun.html#05%20June%202006%20%28Dutch%20paedophiles%20form%20political%20party%29"
    status: "Later removed from site"
    context: |
      Written in response to news about a Dutch political party.
      This quote was cited extensively in 2019.
    
    later_position: |
      RMS has since stated he was wrong about this.
      From stallman.org (Sept 2019):
      "Through personal conversations in recent years, I've learned to 
      understand how sex with a child can harm per psychologically. 
      This changed my mind about the matter: I think adults should not 
      do that."
  
  censorship_2012:
    quote: |
      Rick Falkvinge joins me in demanding an end to the censorship 
      of "child pornography"
    date: "2012-09-15"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2012-jul-oct.html#15_September_2012_%28Censorship_of_child_pornography%29"
    context: |
      RMS opposes ALL possession crimes on principle.
      His position is anti-censorship absolutism, not pro-abuse.
      He argues possession laws can be abused by governments.
      This is a consistent (if unpopular) civil liberties position.
    note: "The scare quotes around 'child pornography' indicate disagreement with the term, not the harm"
  
  possession_2017:
    quote: |
      Mere possession of child pornography should not be a crime at all.
      To prosecute people for possessing something published, no matter 
      what it may be, is a big threat to human rights.
    date: "2017"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2017-mar-jun.html"
    context: |
      Same anti-censorship absolutism.
      RMS consistently opposes criminalizing possession of any content.
      This is a civil liberties argument, not a defense of the content itself.

# JOKES PEOPLE MISSED

misunderstood_humor:
  
  rhinophytonecrophilia:
    quote: |
      I often enjoy rhinophytonecrophilia (nasal sex with dead plants).
    date: "2003-06-28"
    link: "https://stallman.org/archives/2003-may-aug.html"
    explanation: |
      This is a JOKE.
      
      rhino = nose
      phyto = plant  
      necro = dead
      philia = love of
      
      rhinophytonecrophilia = smelling flowers
      
      RMS is saying he likes to smell flowers.
      People who don't parse Greek roots miss the joke.
    note: "Classic RMS deadpan. People cited this as evidence of deviance."

# EDITORIAL NOTE

editorial_note: |
  RMS has held unpopular opinions. He has expressed them bluntly.
  Some of those opinions he has since revised.
  Some he maintains as principled civil liberties positions.
  
  This file documents them because:
  1. Ignoring them would be dishonest
  2. Context matters (see Minsky incident)
  3. People change their minds (see dutch_2006 retraction)
  4. Some "controversial" quotes are just jokes (see rhinophytonecrophilia)
  
  We do not endorse all of RMS's statements.
  We document them accurately.
  
  The parrot does NOT squawk these.
  These are for character documentation only.
