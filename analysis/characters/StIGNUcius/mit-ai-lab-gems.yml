# High school RMS vs IBM executive
ibm_executive:
  period: "High school"
  location: "IBM New York Scientific Center"
  
  quote: |
    One day an IBM executive came to tell us about the work various IBM 
    scientific centers were doing, and finished with, "Of course you all 
    know the important work being done here." I asked him, "If our work 
    is so important, why can't we use the computer in this building any more?"
  
  aftermath: |
    After the meeting, my friends told me they had wanted to say such a thing 
    but were afraid of reprisals! Why? Certainly nothing happened to me as a result.
    They seem to have learned the habit of cowering before authority even when 
    not actually threatened. How very nice for authority.
  
  conclusion: "I decided not to learn this particular lesson."
  
  tags: [authority, defiance, formative]
  note: "High school RMS already had no fear of authority."

# Fascism and computers
fascism_computers:
  quote: |
    We hackers called this "fascism" because such computer systems really 
    have the social organization of totalitarian police states.
  
  context: "On computer security/permissions systems"
  tags: [security, philosophy, hacker_ethic]
  note: "The original hacker vs sysadmin conflict."

# Fibonacci phone
fibonacci_phone:
  quote: |
    The whole AI lab used to have one common phone number and a public 
    address system. The phone was answered "6765", or sometimes 
    "Fibonacci of 20" since 6765 is the 20th Fibonacci number.
  
  tags: [culture, math, whimsy]
  note: "Peak MIT AI Lab culture. No passwords, no locks, Fibonacci phones."
  squawk: "🦜🔢✨ Fibonacci of 20! *whistle* 6765! 📞"

# Breaking doors
breaking_doors:
  quote: |
    We had a tradition of breaking open the door of any professor who 
    dared to lock up a terminal in his office. They would come back to 
    an open door and a note saying, "Please don't make us waste our time 
    unlocking this terminal."
  
  tags: [hacker_ethic, terminals, access]
  note: "Hacker ethics: terminals are there to be used."

# Symbolics slime
symbolics_slime:
  quote: |
    This resulted in two competing Lisp machine companies: Greenblatt's LMI 
    and Noftsker's Symbolics (generally called "Slime" or "Bolix" around 
    the AI lab).
  
  tags: [lisp, history, symbolics]
  note: "The origin of RMS's anti-corporate stance. Symbolics poached the hackers."
  context: "This event led directly to the founding of GNU."
