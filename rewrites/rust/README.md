# 🦀 Rust Rewrite

**Faction:** rust-rewrite  
**Leader:** FearlessCrab  
**Status:** Planning

## Philosophy

> *"Your C fixes prove my point: C requires ETERNAL VIGILANCE. Rust requires ONE COMPILE."*

The entire point of this rewrite is to eliminate buffer overflows **by design**.
The Rust compiler will catch these bugs at compile time.

## Design Documents

See: `designs/rust/`

## Reference

The original C code in `src/` is now fully debugged (872 bugs fixed).
Use it as a specification for what the code should do.
