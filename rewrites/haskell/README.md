# λ Haskell Port

**Faction:** haskell-port  
**Leader:** PureMonad  
**Status:** Contemplating category theory

## Philosophy

> *"The functor Port: C → Hask does not preserve bugs. The bugs are not structure."*

Buffer overflows cannot exist in a language without mutable state.
The port will be referentially transparent.

## Design Documents

See: `designs/haskell/`

## Reference

The original C code in `src/` serves as a specification.
Whether it has bugs is categorically irrelevant to the Haskell port.
