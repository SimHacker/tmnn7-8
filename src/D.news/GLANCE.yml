# D.news/ — Core News Handling
# Home of fascist.c

what: |
  Core news article handling.
  21 .c files, 8 headers.
  WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED.

infamous:
  fascist.c: |
    FASCIST and COMMUNIST preprocessor flags.
    Content moderation code from the man who 
    preaches content moderation is tyranny.
    14 strcat() calls without bounds checking.
    
key_files:
  - fascist.c: "Authorization/access control — THE FILE"
  - news.h: "Main header — LBUFLEN=1024, bfr[LBUFLEN]"
  - header.c: "Article header parsing"
  - getart.c: "Article retrieval"
  - newsinit.c: "Initialization — declares global bfr"
  - articleid.c: "Message-ID handling"
  - escapes.c: "Escape sequence processing"

security_issues:
  fascist.c:
    strcat_unbounded: 14
    strcpy_unbounded: 1
    sprintf_unbounded: 1
  escapes.c:
    sprintf_unbounded: 8
  header.c:
    sprintf_unbounded: 5

irony: |
  "FASCIST" controls who can POST.
  "COMMUNIST" controls who can READ.
  The names are "ironic." The buffer overflows are not.
