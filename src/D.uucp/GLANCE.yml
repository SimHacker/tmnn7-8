# D.uucp/ — UUCP Transport
# The Pre-Internet Internet
# When news traveled by modem, over phone lines, overnight

what: |
  3 C files, 1 header.
  UUCP (Unix-to-Unix Copy) news transport.
  Batch transfers between sites.
  
  Archaeological artifact of networking before TCP/IP won.
  This is how Usenet ACTUALLY worked in 1988.

stats:
  c_files: 3
  h_files: 1
  danger_level: "HISTORICAL"
  
  why_historical: |
    UUCP is obsolete. Nobody uses it for news anymore.
    This code is museum-quality.
    
    But understanding it helps understand the context.
    This was the REAL network layer.

# UUCP Explained
# How news actually moved in 1988

how_it_worked:
  the_basics: |
    UUCP: Unix-to-Unix Copy Protocol
    
    Site A calls Site B's modem (phone line!).
    Sites exchange files using UUCP protocol.
    Hang up. Wait for next scheduled call.
    
    News propagated hop by hop, site by site.
    An article posted in California might take
    DAYS to reach New York. That was normal.
    
  batching: |
    News articles were batched together.
    Compressed (compress.c exists for this!).
    Sent as one big file.
    Unbatched on the other end.
    
    sendbatch.c and unbatch.c in the top-level src/.
    
  scheduling: |
    Sites would call each other at night.
    Long-distance was cheaper at night.
    "L.sys" (or "Systems") file configured who to call when.
    
    snark would call cbmvax at 2 AM.
    cbmvax would call snark at 3 AM.
    Eventually, news reached everywhere.
    
  the_map: |
    comp.mail.maps published UUCP maps.
    Literal maps of how sites connected.
    You could trace the path your news would take:
    
    yoursite!intermediate!destination
    
    "Bang paths" — the ! separated hops.

# Files
# The UUCP machinery

files:
  uucp.c:
    purpose: "UUCP protocol handling"
    handles:
      - "Batch creation"
      - "Transmission scheduling"
      - "Error handling"
    note: "The main UUCP interface"
    
  uuxqt.c:
    purpose: "UUCP execution daemon interface"
    handles:
      - "Queue management"
      - "Execution requests"
    note: "uuxqt processed remote execution requests"
    
  uuname.c:
    purpose: "UUCP site naming"
    handles:
      - "Site name resolution"
      - "Path construction"
    note: "How to reach another site"

# The UUCP Network
# The topology of pre-Internet Usenet

topology:
  backbone_sites: |
    Some sites were "backbone" — well-connected hubs.
    seismo, ucbvax, decwrl, uunet.
    Many sites fed from them.
    
  leaf_nodes: |
    Most sites were "leaves" — connected to one or two others.
    They received news, maybe forwarded to a few neighbors.
    
  the_cost: |
    Phone calls cost money. Especially long distance.
    Bandwidth was 1200 baud (later 9600, 14400...).
    Every byte transferred had a cost.
    
    This is why news batching mattered.
    This is why compression mattered.
    This is why "wasteful" posts were frowned upon.
    
  propagation_delay: |
    Post in San Francisco on Monday.
    Reaches Chicago by Tuesday night.
    Reaches New York by Wednesday.
    Reaches Europe by Thursday... maybe.
    
    "Real-time" was not a concept.

# Why This Matters
# Historical context for the whole project

significance:
  this_is_real: |
    When you see %feeds with "snark:comp,news..."
    Those are REAL UUCP feed configurations.
    snark really called cbmvax really called vu-vlsi.
    
    This code moved actual news over actual phone lines.
    
  the_transition: |
    NNTP (D.network/) was the future.
    TCP/IP won. The Internet replaced UUCP.
    
    But in 1988, UUCP was still dominant.
    This code lived in both worlds.
    
  the_lesson: |
    Understanding UUCP helps understand:
    - Why batching exists
    - Why compression matters
    - Why news has "Path:" headers
    - Why bandwidth was precious
    - Why "the net" was slower and more thoughtful

# Security in the UUCP Era
# Different threat model

security_then:
  trust_model: |
    UUCP sites trusted each other.
    You had to know the phone number to call.
    You had to have login credentials.
    
    The "firewall" was: "Don't publish your modem number."
    
  remote_execution: |
    UUCP supported remote execution: "run this command."
    uux could execute commands on remote systems.
    
    This was TERRIFYING by modern standards.
    But sites trusted each other. It was a smaller world.
    
  the_shift: |
    When the Internet opened up, this trust model broke.
    Anyone could send you packets.
    UUCP security assumptions became liabilities.
