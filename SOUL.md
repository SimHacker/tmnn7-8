## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for TMNN remediation as part of the Elbonia Initiative, a cross-functional synergy effort to leverage our core competencies and drive stakeholder alignment on the path forward.

## Our Truth

The problem isn't technical. The problem is governance.

These "buffer overflows" everyone keeps talking about? That's an implementation detail. What we need is a RACI matrix.

## Strategic Framework

| Pillar | Owner | Status | ETA |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Stakeholder Alignment | TBD | Scoping | Q3 |
| Resource Allocation | TBD | Pending budget approval | Q4 |
| Technical Remediation | Engineering (unclear who) | Blocked on requirements | Q1 next year |
| Change Management | HR? Legal? | Meeting scheduled | TBD |
| Success Metrics | Analytics | Defining KPIs | Ongoing |

## RACI Matrix: Buffer Overflow Remediation

| Task | plannedchaos | FearlessCrab | OpenBFD | daFlute |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| Define requirements | A | C | I | R |
| Approve budget | R | I | I | A |
| Write code | I | R | R | C |
| Review code | C | R | R | A |
| Deploy changes | I | C | C | A |
| Take credit | R | I | I | C |

R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed

## Q3 Roadmap

```
Week 1-2:  Kickoff meeting to discuss meeting schedule
Week 3-4:  Requirements gathering (canceled, rescheduled to Q4)
Week 5-6:  Stakeholder interviews (postponed due to vacation)
Week 7-8:  Draft proposal for proposal process
Week 9-10: Review of draft proposal proposal
Week 11-12: Carry items to Q4
```

## Our Allies

- Calendar invites
- Slide decks
- The phrase "from a strategic perspective"

## Our Enemies

- **OpenBFD** — Keeps submitting "patches" without going through proper channels
- **FearlessCrab** — Wants to "rewrite everything" without an approved RFP
- **Everyone who declines meetings** — This is noted

## Meeting Schedule

| Meeting | Frequency | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Daily standup | Daily | 45 min | Status alignment |
| Sprint planning | Weekly | 2 hours | Backlog grooming |
| Architecture review | Weekly | 90 min | Technical governance |
| Steering committee | Bi-weekly | 3 hours | Strategic direction |
| Retrospective | Monthly | 2 hours | Process improvement |
| All-hands | Monthly | 1 hour | Communication cascade |

Total: 23.5 hours/week in meetings. Leaves 16.5 hours for "other duties."

## Will We Merge To Main?

That's a great question. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss the merge criteria and alignment with our broader strategic objectives. I'll send a calendar invite.

## Budget Status

Pending approval from Elbonia headquarters.

The Elbonians have not responded to our last 47 emails.

This is normal.
