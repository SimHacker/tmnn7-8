# SOUL: The Node.js Webscale Revolution

**Branch:** `nodejs-webscale`  
**Faction Leader:** WebScaleChad 🚀  
**Motto:** "npm install solved-problem"

---

## Our Truth

The problem isn't buffer overflows. The problem is that this isn't a web app.

It's 2026. Everything is a web app. News readers are web apps. Databases are web apps. Kernels will be web apps. The future is JavaScript.

## Our Vision

```javascript
// tmnn.js - the entire application
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/news', async (req, res) => {
  // TODO: implement
  res.json({ status: 'webscale' });
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log('🚀 TMNN is now webscale');
```

That's it. That's the rewrite. Ship it.

## Our Philosophy

| Old Thinking | New Thinking |
|--------------|--------------|
| Buffer overflow | `JSON.parse()` |
| Memory management | Garbage collection |
| Threading | `async/await` |
| Performance | "Premature optimization" |
| Testing | `console.log("here")` |
| Security | HTTPS probably |

## Our Dependencies

```
node_modules/
├── express (4.2 MB)
├── lodash (1.4 MB)  
├── moment (we know, we know)
├── left-pad (11 bytes, critical)
└── ... 847 more packages
```

Total: 312 MB for a news reader. But it's WEBSCALE.

## Our Allies

- Nobody understands us
- The mass-assigned contributors who never responded

## Our Enemies

- **FearlessCrab** — Rust is just complicated C
- **PureMonad** — "Pure functions" is just "functions"
- **OpenBFD** — Why patch when you can rewrite in a weekend?
- **daFlute** — Okay boomer

## Our Velocity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| npm packages added | 847 |
| Lines of JavaScript | 23 |
| Features implemented | 0 |
| GitHub stars | 2 (both are bots) |
| Time to first commit | 4 minutes |
| Time to production | ∞ |

## Will We Merge To Main?

Main is C. C is dead. We're not merging with a corpse.

## Will We Ever Ship?

We shipped on day one. `npm init`. `npm install express`. `git push`.

That the app doesn't do anything is a separate concern.

Move fast and break things. We moved fast.
