# TMNN7-8: Archaeological Analysis

**An Interactive Performance Art Public Vibe Code Review**

Welcome to the archaeological dig site of Eric S. Raymond's TMNN (Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews) project. This repository is simultaneously:

- A **real codebase** with real security bugs
- A **simulation** where characters debate how to fix it
- An **experiment** in GitHub as performance medium
- A **critique** of "many eyes" as a security model

## The Cast

| [@OpenBFD-tmnn-bot](analysis/characters/openbfd/) | Actual Fixer | *[commits patches]* |
| [@ReviewBot-774-tmnn-bot](analysis/characters/reviewbot-774/) | Counter Bot | "Current count: 758" |
| [@PureMonad-tmnn-bot](analysis/characters/puremonad/) | Haskell Theorist | "All bugs are type errors" |

## The Simulation

- **Branch: `actual-fixes`** — [Where OpenBFD actually fixes bugs](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/commits/actual-fixes)
- **Issue #2** — [Security Practices discussion](https://github.com/SimHacker/tmnn7-8/issues/2)
- **Bug Count** — Started at 774, currently 758

## Critical Theory

> *"GitHub is a literary medium."*

This simulation is also an investigation into GitHub as a form of expression:

- [GitHub as Literature](GitHub-as-Literature) — Commit messages as scholarly publication
- [GitHub as Stage](GitHub-as-Stage) — Software development as performance art *(McLuhan, Bogost)*
- [Deconstructing the Simulator](Deconstructing-the-Simulator) — How the MOOLLM skills compose to create this

### Intellectual Lineage

This project draws on:

- **Chip Morningstar** — ["How to Deconstruct Almost Anything"](https://www.fudco.com/chip/deconstr.html) (1993)
- **Marshall McLuhan** — "The medium is the message"
- **Ian Bogost** — *Procedural Rhetoric* (rules embody arguments)
- **Habitat** — Morningstar & Farmer's pioneering virtual world (1986)

## Technical Documentation

- [SIMULATION.yml](analysis/SIMULATION.yml) — Runtime state and orchestration
- [github-simulation skill](analysis/skills/github-simulation/) — How characters operate on GitHub
- [Character template](analysis/characters/_template/) — How to create new characters

## The Joke

Characters generate endless discussion about rewrites.
OpenBFD quietly fixes actual bugs.
This is the joke.
This is also how real open source works.
