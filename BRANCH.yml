  maintainer: SimHacker
  created: 2026-01-30

soul: |
  We are the archive. We preserve the evidence. We host the stage.
  The factions fight. The characters debate. The code remains.
  We do not take sides. We document evidence.

goals:
  - Preserve original TMNN 7.8 codebase unchanged
  - Document archaeological findings with evidence
  - Host character definitions (shared across all timelines)
  - Provide stage infrastructure for performance

ideology: |
  The code speaks for itself.
  Numbers are grep output, not opinions.
  Characters are archetypes, not people.
  🎭 prefix signals roleplay.

  The man who wrote "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" 
  had zero eyeballs on his own code for two years in "secret laboratories."
