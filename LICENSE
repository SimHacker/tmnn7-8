		 NETNEWS GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

         Copyright (C) 1988 by Eric S. Raymond (eric@snark.uu.net)
   You may distribute verbatim copies of this license but not modify it.

BY COMPILING AND INSTALLING THE NETNEWS SOFTWARE, YOU ENTER AN AGREEMENT
WITH ERIC S. RAYMOND AND THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION TO ABIDE BY THE
LICENSE TERMS SPELLED OUT BELOW. READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.

                   AUTHOR'S STATEMENT OF INTENT

   I support strict intellectual property laws and the right of designers
to own, control, and dispose of their creative work in whatever ways and
under whatever terms the free market will allow. I oppose any and all
attempts to alienate designers from their work by denying them property
rights therein, including denial of the right to hold software proprietary.

   I have nevertheless, in the belief that an abundance of voluntarily
contributed free software is a worthy goal, opted to issue Netnews under the
aegis of the Free Software Foundation and under terms very similar to those
of the GNU Emacs General Public License (only the portion that would have
required the software to display a nuisance message on startup has been
deleted).

   My action is not to be construed as an endorsement of the political or
economic views or personal crusades of any member, agent, or ally of the
Free Software Foundation other than myself. I support *voluntary* sharing.

   My work has been directed towards the end of increasing individual freedom
and empowerment through the means of increasing individual information wealth.
Believing as I do that this goal may be best accomplished within a society of
private enterprise and free markets, I not only permit but encourage commercial
and for-profit use of this software.

   If you respect my work and my intentions, please guide your use of the news
software by respect for personal, political, and economic freedom; by support
for natural property and contract rights; and by affirming the autonomy and
privacy of individuals and voluntary associations.

   And, most especially, please join me in opposing unconditionally every form
of and rationalization for censorship. The marketplace of ideas is, ultimately,
the most important free market of all.

		AN UNABASHED COMMERCIAL PLUG

   I am available at competitive rates as a consultant to any organization
wishing to use customized netnews versions as an information-sharing tool. 
As of April 1989 I can be reached via voice at (215)-296-5718 or by mail at
22 South Warren Avenue, Malvern PA 19355; don't hesitate to call.

                         LICENSE TERMS

  The license agreements of most software companies keep you at the
mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our general public license is
intended to give everyone the right to share Netnews.  To make
sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make
restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
to surrender the rights.  Hence this license agreement.

  Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of Netnews, that you receive source code or else can get it
if you want it, that you can change Netnews or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of Netnews, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for Netnews.  If Netnews is
modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know
that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.

  Therefore we (Eric S. Raymond and the Free Software Foundation,
Inc.) make the following terms which say what you must do to be
allowed to distribute or change Netnews.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of Netnews source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each file a valid copyright notice such
as "Copyright (C) 1988 Eric S. Raymond", containing the year of
last change and name of copyright holder for the file in question;
keep intact the notices on all files that refer to this License
Agreement and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
recipients of the Netnews program a copy of this License Agreement
along with the program.  You may charge a distribution fee for the
physical act of transferring a copy.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Netnews source code or
any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under
the terms of Paragraph 1 above, provided that you also do the following:

    a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    who last changed such files and the date of any change; and

    b) require the whole of any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of Netnews
    or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third
    parties on terms identical to those contained in this License
    Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive
    warranty protection to third parties, at your option).

    c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of
    transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
    protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may copy and distribute Netnews or any portion of it in
compiled, executable or object code form under the terms of Paragraphs
1 and 2 above provided that you do the following:

    a) cause each such copy of the portion of Netnews incorporated in the
    product to be accompanied by the corresponding machine-readable source
    code; or

    b) cause each such copy of Netnews to be accompanied by a
    written offer, with no time limit, to give any third party
    free (except for a nominal shipping charge) a machine-readable
    copy of the corresponding source code; or

    c) in the case of a recipient of Netnews in compiled, executable
    or object code form (without the corresponding source code) you
    shall cause copies you distribute to be accompanied by a copy
    of the written offer of source code which you received along
    with the copy of Netnews.

  4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Netnews
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer Netnews is void and
your rights to use Netnews under this License agreement shall be
automatically terminated.  However, parties who have received computer
software programs from you with this License Agreement will not have
their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. If you wish to incorporate parts of Netnews into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author and/or
the Free Software Foundation.  We have not yet worked out a simple rule that
can be stated here, but we will often permit this.  We will be guided by the
two goals of preserving the free status of derivatives of our free software
and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software.

			   NO WARRANTY

  BECAUSE NETNEWS IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, WE PROVIDE ABSOLUTELY
NO WARRANTY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE STATE LAW.  EXCEPT
WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC,
ERIC S. RAYMOND AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE NETNEWS STRICTLY "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE NETNEWS
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

    IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW WILL FREE SOFTWARE
FOUNDATION, INC., ERIC S. RAYMOND, AND/OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND REDISTRIBUTE NETNEWS AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST MONIES, OR OTHER
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH PROGRAMS NOT DISTRIBUTED BY
FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION, INC.) THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY
OTHER PARTY.

    IN NO EVENT WILL THE FREE SOFTWARE FOUNDATION OR ERIC S. RAYMOND BE LIABLE
FOR ANY MISAPPROPRIATION OF CREATIVE WORK OR VIOLATION OF COPYRIGHT OR TRADE
SECRET PRIVILEGES OF NEWS ARTICLE AUTHORS INVOLVING THE NETNEWS SOFTWARE AS A
CHANNEL OR DISTRIBUTION MEANS. THE ENTIRE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESPECTING RIGHTS
AND PRIVILEGES RETAINED BY AUTHORS OF COPYRIGHTED OR TRADE-SECRET PROTECTED
WORKS RESTS ON YOU.
