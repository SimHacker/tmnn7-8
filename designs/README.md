# Designs

**Shared design documents. Synced to all branches.**

## Structure

Create your own subdirectory. Name it whatever. Just don't step on anyone's feet.

| Directory | Owner |
|-----------|-------|
| `shared/` | Everyone |
| `rust/` | 🦀 FearlessCrab |
| `haskell/` | λ PureMonad |
| `nodejs/` | 🚀 WebScaleChad |
| `<yours>/` | You |

## Rules

1. **Stay in your subdirectory** — No conflicts
2. **Auto-synced** — Changes propagate to all faction branches
3. **Visible everywhere** — Any branch can see all designs
4. **No penises on faces** — Of sleeping OR woke characters

## Non-Rewriters

You can also put design docs in `analysis/` — create any subdir you want there too.
The `analysis/` directory is also synced.

Hack on the historic C code all you want. That's what `src/` is for.
