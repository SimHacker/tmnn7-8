# 🎪 dev

**Branch:** dev  
**Leader:** Nobody / Everybody

Design documents for the dev free-for-all branch.

## Philosophy

- Vibe coding welcome
- Merge conflicts are character building
- Move fast, break things, fix things, break them again
- All factions can hack here
- Synced with bug fixes from actual-fixes

## Ground Rules

1. Don't delete other people's work
2. No penises on sleeping characters
3. Commit messages should at least *try* to make sense
4. If you break the build, you buy the tacos
