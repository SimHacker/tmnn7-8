# 🎪 dev Designs

**Branch:** dev  
**Leader:** Nobody / Everybody  
**Vibe:** Controlled chaos

Design documents for the free-for-all development branch.

## Philosophy

> "The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas." — Linus Pauling  
> "Most of them will be terrible." — Also true

This is where experiments happen. Some will succeed. Many will fail gloriously.

## What dev Is For

- 🧪 **Experiments** — Try wild ideas
- 🔀 **Integration** — Merge different faction work
- 💥 **Breaking things** — Then fixing them
- 🎨 **Vibe coding** — Sometimes you just gotta flow
- 🤝 **Collaboration** — Cross-faction work

## What dev Is NOT For

- 🚫 Production code
- 🚫 Stable releases
- 🚫 Anything ESR needs to approve

## Ground Rules

| Rule | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Don't delete other people's work | Revert + apology |
| No penises on sleeping characters | Immediate ban from taco parties |
| Commit messages should try to make sense | Public shaming |
| Break the build, buy the tacos | 🌮🌮🌮 |
| Merge conflicts are character building | No whining |

## Current State

- ✅ Synced with 872 bug fixes from `actual-fixes`
- ✅ Has all architecture (rust/, haskell/, nodejs/, designs/)
- 🎪 Ready for chaos

## Active Experiments

*Document ongoing experiments here.*

| Experiment | Owner | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| *None yet* | — | — |

## Merge Policy

1. **From dev to feature branches:** Cherry-pick what you need
2. **From feature branches to dev:** Merge freely
3. **From dev to main:** Never directly. Go through actual-fixes.

## Design Documents

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| `experiment-log.md` | What we tried and learned | TODO |
| `integration-notes.md` | Cross-faction gotchas | TODO |
| `cleanup-needed.md` | Technical debt tracker | TODO |

## The Taco Fund

Current balance: **$0**

| Date | Contributor | Amount | Reason |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| — | — | — | No build breaks yet! |

*First person to break the build funds the taco party.*
